 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Experiment Overview <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 In the experiment today you will be  matched into pairs, and will be asked to make choices. <break time="1s"></break> The choices made by you may  affect both your payoff, as well as  the payoff of the subject that you are matched with. <break time="1s"></break> Similarly, the choices of the subject that you are matched with may  affect their payoff and your payoff. <break time="1s"></break> 

 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Experiment Details <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
 
In the experiment today, you will be working with a fictitious currency called Francs. <break time="1s"></break> You will be paid in US Dollars at the end of the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
  Exchange rate : <break time="0.5s"></break> 20 Francs = $1. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
 This experiment consists of  five matches, each of which may have a different number of periods, and may have different payoffs. <break time="1s"></break> 
At the beginning of each match,  you will be matched with one other subject that you have not been matched with before. <break time="1s"></break> The random pairing will ensure that if you have been paired with another participant before, then you will never be paired with this same participant in another match again. <break time="1s"></break> 
You will remain  anonymous throughout the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> You will not know the identity of the subject that you are matched with, and the subject that you are matched with will not know your identity. <break time="1s"></break> 
The choices made by you, and the subject that you are matched with, have no effect on the payoffs of other pairs of subjects, and vice versa. <break time="1s"></break> 
You will remain matched with this  same subject until the end of the match. <break time="1s"></break> 
After you and the subject that you are matched with have finished the match, please wait quietly for all pairs to finish their match. <break time="1s"></break> 
Once all pairs have finished their match, you will be  randomly rematched with another subject that you have not been matched with yet, and the next match will begin. <break time="1s"></break> 
 

 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Experimental Interface <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
 
Next, we will go over the experimental interface. <break time="1s"></break> The experimental interface consists of five components: <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
1. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break>  The payoff table is displayed at the top left of the screen. <break time="1s"></break> The payoff table has your choices <break time="0.5s"></break> (the rows,  U, and  D) <break time="0.5s"></break>, and the choices of the subject that you are matched with <break time="0.5s"></break> (the columns,  L, and  R) <break time="0.5s"></break>. <break time="1s"></break> For any combination of choices for you and the subject that you are matched with, there is a payoff. <break time="1s"></break> Your payoff is on the left, and the payoff for the subject that you are matched with is on the right. <break time="1s"></break> For example, if you  choose D, and the subject that you are matched with  chooses L,  then your payoff is 6, and  the payoff for the subject that you are matched with is 3. <break time="1s"></break> The payoff table in the experiment today will be different than the one displayed here. <break time="1s"></break> In addition, the payoffs will remain the same for all periods in a single match, but may change in different matches. <break time="1s"></break> 
2. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break>  The summary of the current period is shown in the top right. <break time="1s"></break> 
3. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break>  The summary of all periods is shown below that. <break time="1s"></break> 
4. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break>  The history of play is displayed in the bottom half of the screen. <break time="1s"></break> 
5. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break>  Finally, the current status is displayed across the middle of the screen. <break time="1s"></break> The current status tells you what to do at any point during the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
 

 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Specific Instructions for Each Period <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
 
At any point during a period, you will see one of three status messages: <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 Status #1: <break time="0.5s"></break> Please select My Choice <break time="0.5s"></break> (U,D) <break time="0.5s"></break> and your guess for Other's Choice <break time="0.5s"></break> (L,R) <break time="0.5s"></break>. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
When you see this status message, you need to do two things. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
1. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> Select a row for your choice <break time="0.5s"></break> (in this example either U, or D) <break time="0.5s"></break>. <break time="1s"></break>  Once you have selected a row, it will be outlined, and the label 'My Choice' will be added. <break time="1s"></break>  My choice will also be updated on the period summary. <break time="1s"></break> 
2. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> Select the column that you think the subject that you are matched with will select <break time="0.5s"></break> (in this example either L, or R) <break time="0.5s"></break>. <break time="1s"></break>  Once you have selected a column, it will be outlined, and the label 'My Guess' will be added. <break time="1s"></break>  My guess will also be updated on the period summary. <break time="1s"></break> If you correctly guess the choice of the subject that you are matched with in a given period, then you will earn a raffle ticket. <break time="1s"></break> At the end of the experiment, one raffle ticket will be randomly selected, and the winner will receive a bonus of \5. <break time="1s"></break> Therefore, the more correct guesses you make, the more likely you are to win the \5 bonus. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
 
  Status #2: <break time="0.5s"></break> Please wait for the other subject to finish making their choices. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
When you see this status message, please wait patiently for the subject that you are matched with to finish making their choices. <break time="1s"></break> 
If the other subject makes their choices before you in a specific period, you might not see this status. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
  Status #3: <break time="0.5s"></break> Click on the payoffs for this period <break time="0.5s"></break> (in green) <break time="0.5s"></break> in the game table to move to next period. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
When you see this status message, all choices for the period have been made, and you can view the final results. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The column selected by the subject that you are matched with is highlighted and labeled 'Other's Choice'. <break time="1s"></break> If your guess about their choice was correct, then the column will be highlighted in yellow. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The entry of the payoff table that is at the intersection of the row that you selected, and the column that the subject that you are matched with selected, is highlighted in green. <break time="1s"></break> 
This entry displays the payoffs for the current period. <break time="1s"></break> Your payoff for the period is displayed on the left, and the payoff of the subject that you are matched with is displayed on the right. <break time="1s"></break> 
At this point, the period summary has been updated to include  the choice of the subject that you are matched with,  and the current payoffs for this period. <break time="1s"></break> These choices have also been added to the  history of play at the bottom of the screen. <break time="1s"></break> 
 Finally,  the overall summary has been updated to include  the total payoffs including this period, as well as  the number of correct guesses you have made about the choice of the subject that you are matched with. <break time="1s"></break> 
  To move on to the next period, you need to click the payoffs for this period in the game table, which have been highlighted in  green. <break time="1s"></break> [[slnc 3000]] 
 
 

 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Number of Periods Per Match <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
 
The number of periods in each match will be determined randomly using the following procedure. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
At the end of each period,  a number will be chosen randomly from the set of numbers  {1,2,3, up to, 98, 99, 100}, where each number is equally likely. <break time="1s"></break> 
  If the number is 1, then the match will end. <break time="1s"></break> 
  If the number is not 1, then the match will continue. <break time="1s"></break> 
The number will always be placed back into the set after it is drawn. <break time="1s"></break> 
Thus, in any period there is a 1% CHANCE that the match will end, and a 99% CHANCE that the match will have another period. <break time="1s"></break> 
Therefore,  the expected number of periods in each match will be 100. <break time="1s"></break> 
  This procedure has been performed on the computer before the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> Therefore, you will not see the number selected from {1,2,3, up to, 98, 99, 100}. <break time="1s"></break> 
To ensure that the length of the match is not dependent on your play, the number of periods for each match has been written on the board before the experiment, and will be uncovered at the end of the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
 

 <break time="0.5s"></break>  Payoffs <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
 
  Your payment at the end of the experiment will contain the following: <break time="0.5s"></break> 
  
1. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> The \5 show up fee. <break time="1s"></break>  
2. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> Payment for a randomly selected block of 30 periods. <break time="1s"></break>  
3. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> A bonus payment of \5 if one of your raffle tickets is randomly selected at the end of the experiment. <break time="1s"></break>  
4. <break time="1s"></break> <break time="0.5s"></break> Payment for the additional tasks after the main experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
 
At the end of the experiment,  your earnings in Francs will be converted into US Dollars and you will be  paid in cash, in private. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The randomly selected block of 30 periods will be determined as follows: <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
  One period from the experiment will be selected at random. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The block of 30 periods will contain this period, and the following 29 periods. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The block of 30 periods may span multiple matches. <break time="1s"></break> 
  If the randomly selected period is one of the last 29 periods of the experiment, then the block will loop around to the first period of the experiment, and continue from there. <break time="1s"></break> 
  Therefore, the chance of getting paid in every period of the experiment is the same. <break time="1s"></break> Each choice you make is therefore important because it has a chance of determining the amount of money you earn. <break time="1s"></break> 
  The randomly selected period has been drawn before the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
To ensure that the randomly selected period is not dependent on your choices, it has been written on the board, and will be uncovered at the end of the experiment. <break time="1s"></break> 
  Here are some examples: <break time="0.5s"></break> 
 
First, a regular example. <break time="1s"></break>  If the random period is period 14 of match number 4,  then the block will contain periods 14 through 43 of match number 4. <break time="1s"></break> 
Next, and example that spans multiple matches. <break time="1s"></break>  If match number 2 has 100 periods, and the randomly selected period is period 91 of match number 2,  then the block will contain periods 91 through 100 of match number 2, and periods 1 through 20 of match number 3. <break time="1s"></break> 
Finally, an example that loops around to the beginning. <break time="1s"></break>  If match number 5 has 85 periods, and the randomly selected period is period 81 of match number 5,  then the block will contain periods 81 through 85 of match number 5, and periods 1 through 25 of match number 1. <break time="1s"></break>
