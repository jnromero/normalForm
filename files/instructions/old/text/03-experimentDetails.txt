Experiment Details. [[slnc 500]]

This experiment consists of three matches, each of which may have a different number of rounds.  At the beginning of each match, you will be matched with one other subject that you have not been matched with before.  You will remain anonymous throughout the experiment. You will not know the identity of the subject you are matched with, and the subject you are matched with will not know your identity.  The choices made by you, and the subject you are matched with, have no effect on the payoffs of subjects in other pairs and vice versa.  You will remain matched with this same subject until the end of the match.  After you and the subject you are matched with have finished the match, please wait quietly for all pairs to finish their match.
Once all pairs have finished their match, you will be randomly rematched with another subject that you have not been matched with yet, and the next match will begin.



You will be working with a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid in U S Dollars at the end of the experiment.

The Exchange rate today is, 500 Francs, equals, one U S Dollar.

At the end of each round, a number will be choosen randomly from {1, 2, 3, . . . , 98, 99, 100}, where each number is equally likely.
