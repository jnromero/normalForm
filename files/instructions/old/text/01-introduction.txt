[[3]] Experiment Overview. [[slnc 500]]

You are about to participate in an [[1]] experiment in the economics of decision-making. If you listen carefully, [[1]] you could earn a large amount of money, that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the end of the experiment.  It is important [[1]] that you remain silent, and do not look at other peoples work.  If you have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, [[1]] please raise your hand and an experimenter will help you out.  [[3]] During the experiment, [[1]] do not talk, laugh, or exclaim out loud, and be sure to [[1]] keep your eyes on your screen only.  In addition, [[1]] please turn off your cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the experiment.  Anybody that violates these rules will be asked to leave and will not be paid. [[1]] We expect, and appreciate your cooperation.[[slnc 500]]
