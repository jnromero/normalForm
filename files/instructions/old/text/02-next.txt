[[3]] Welcome to [[1]] the [[1]] Ehconomic Science [[1]] Laboratory. [[slnc 250]]

Please carefully watch these video instructions and follow along on the paper copy at your desk.  [[slnc 500]]

[[3]] Experiment Overview. [[slnc 500]]

You are about to participate in an [[1]] experiment in the economics of decision-making. If you listen carefully, [[1]] you could earn a large amount of money, that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the end of the experiment.  It is important [[1]] that you remain silent, and do not look at other peoples work.  If you have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, [[1]] please raise your hand and an experimenter will help you out.  [[3]] During the experiment, [[1]] do not talk, laugh, or exclaim out loud, and be sure to [[1]] keep your eyes on your screen only.  In addition, [[1]] please turn off your cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the experiment.  Anybody that violates these rules will be asked to leave and will not be paid. [[1]] We expect, and appreciate your cooperation.[[slnc 500]]

[[3]] Agenda [[slnc 500]]

[[1]] 1. [[slnc 250]] We will first go over the instructions.[[slnc 500]]
[[1]] 2. [[slnc 250]] Then we will have a practice match to learn the interface.[[slnc 500]]
[[1]] 3. [[slnc 250]] There will be a quiz with 10 questions to make sure everyone understands the instructions. On the quiz, you will be able to earn up to 50 cents for each of 10 quiz questions, for a total of 5 dollars. If you answer the question correctly on your first attempt, [[1]] you earn 50 cents. If you answer the question incorrectly on your first attempt, and correctly on your second attempt, [[1]] then you earn 25 cents. If you don’t answer the question correctly on your first two attempts, [[1]] you will earn nothing and the answer will be explained to you. You must still answer the question correctly to move on to the next question.[[slnc 500]]
[[1]] 4. [[slnc 250]] After the quiz, the experiment will begin. In the experiment you will be working with a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid in US Dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange rate today is: [[1]] 500 Francs [[slnc 100]] = 1 US Dollar.[[slnc 500]]

[[3]] Experiment Details [[slnc 500]]

[[1]] This experiment consists of ten matches. [[slnc 500]][[1]] At the beginning of each match, you will be paired randomly with one other participant. You will remain matched with this same participant until the end of the match, [[1]] but then will be paired with another randomly selected participant in the following match.  Each match will have the same structure,[[1]] but may contain a different number of periods. [[slnc 500]][[1]] You will remain anonymous throughout the experiment. [[slnc 500]] You will not know the identity of the participant that you are paired with, and they will not know your identity. [[1]] The choices made by you, and the participant you are paired with, have no effect on the payoffs of participants in other pairs, and vice versa. [[slnc 500]] Therefore, your payoff in a given match is based solely on the choices made by you, and the participant that you are paired with.
 [[slnc 500]][[3]] Next, Lets Look at the experimental Interface [[slnc 2000]]

Specific Instructions for Each Period [[slnc 500]]

Your payoff in each period will depend on your choice, and the choice of the participant that you are paired with.  You will choose one of two options, either W or Y .  You will be able to see the payoffs for each combination of choices for you and the participant
that you are paired with.  These payoffs will remain the same throughout the entire experiment (all matches).  [[2]]The payoffs will be displayed in a table like this: [[slnc 2000]]


In this example above, the rows are the following: [[slnc 500]]

[[1]]Row #1 [[slnc 250]] Your choice. [[slnc 250]] (either W or Y in this example.)[[slnc 500]] 
[[2]]Row #2 [[slnc 250]] Other’s choice. [[slnc 250]] (either W or Y in this example.)[[slnc 500]] 
[[2]]Row #3 [[slnc 250]] Your payoff.[[slnc 500]] 
[[2]]Row #4 [[slnc 250]] Other’s payoff.[[slnc 500]] 
[[2]]Row #5 [[slnc 250]] Total number of times that that combination has been played this match.[[slnc 500]] 


[[1]]For example, in the table above, [[1]] if you choose W, [[1]] and the participant you are paired with chooses Y , [[1]] then you receive a payoff of 3, [[1]] and the other participant receives a payoff of 4. [[1]] This combination has occurred 19 times so far this match. [[5]]
In the table above, [[1]]if you choose W, [[1]]and the participant you are paired with chooses W, [[1]]then you receive a payoff of 7, [[1]]and the other participant receives a payoff of 8. [[6]]
In the table above, [[1]]if you choose Y, [[1]]and the participant you are paired with chooses Y , [[1]]then you receive a payoff of 1, [[1]]and the other participant receives a payoff of 2.  [[8]]
 [[slnc 500]]

[[1]]History [[slnc 500]]

As the match pro gresses, you will see the history of play across the top of the screen, [[2]]displayed like this: [[slnc 2000]] The history tells [[1]]your choice (labeled My Choice), [[2]]the choice of the participant you are paired with (labeled Other’s Choice), [[2]] the current period, [[2]] and the payoff for the current period. [[1]] In the above example, [[3]]you played W, and the participant you are paired with played Y in period 39.[[3]][[slnc 1000]]

[[2]]Rules [[slnc 500]]

Rather than directly making choices of W or Y , you will develop a set of rules which will automatically make choices 4 you. [[slnc 500]]
[[2]]The set of rules will appear in the middle of the screen. [[slnc 500]]
You will be able to construct rules using [[2]]the rule constructor at the bottom of the screen. [[1]][[slnc 500]]
[[2]]A rule consists of two parts:[[slnc 500]]
[[1]]Input Sequence [[slnc 500]] - A sequence of choices by you and the participant you are paired with.[[slnc 500]]
[[2]]Output [[slnc 500]]- A choice to be made by you after the input sequence occurs. [[1]][[slnc 500]]

 [[1]]Some example rules are displayed below: [[slnc 500]]
 For example, [[1]]Rule #2 has an input sequence of [[2]] YY  [[4]] ,WW [[4]] ,YW, [[2]]and [[1]]an output of W. [[1]]This means that if you have played[[3]] Y-W-Y in the last three periods, [[3]]and the participant that you are paired with has played[[3]] Y-W-W, this rule will lead you[[4]] to play W in the next period. [[1]]
 [[1]]The length of the rule is measured by the length of the input sequence.[[slnc 500]]
 Therefore, [[2]]rule #2 and rule #3 have a length of 3 [[2]][[slnc 500]], [[1]]and rule #4 has a length of 2. [[slnc 500]][[3]]
There are several ways that you can modify your rules during the experiment.

[[3]]First, you can use the rule constructor in the bottom center of the screen. [[17]] Press the plus button to add more columns or one of the minus buttons to subtract columns. [[18]] Click on the question marks to fill in the boxes. When you click on a question mark, either a W or a Y will appear. If you click on a W, [[3]] it will switch to a Y, and if you click on a Y, [[3]] it will switch to a W. [[slnc 500]] [[7]] Once you have completely filled in the rule (leaving no question marks), the add rule button will appear, [[3]] and the rule can be added to your set. [[slnc 1000]]
Second, [[1]] if you look at a rule in the set, you will notice a [[1]] green copy button [[slnc 500]] and a [[2]] red delete button [[slnc 500]]. [[2]] If you press the copy button, [[2]] it will copy the rule down to the constructor and you will be able to create a similar rule. [[1]] If you press the red delete button [[2]] it will delete the rule from the set.[[slnc 1000]]

Since your rule set needs to make a single choice each period, it is not possible to have two different rules with the same input sequence, but with different outputs. [[7]] If you create a rule that has the same input sequence but a different output, [[1]] you will get an error that says “Conflicting rule in set,” [[1]] and a button that says “Switch Rule” will appear. If you press this button, [[2]] it will delete the conflicting rule from the rule set, and add the rule from the constructor.

A rule of length n [[slnc 250]] is said to fit the history, if the input sequence matches the last n periods of the history.
For example, since the last three periods of play in the above history (periods 42 through 44) have been [[2]] YY, [[2]] WW, and [[2]] YW, and that sequence is also the [[6]] input for rule #2, then rule #2 is said to fit the history. [[12]] Similarly, given the above history, we can see that [[8]] rule #4 fits the history, [[20]]but rule #3 does not fit the history. [[12]] [[slnc 500]]

As play pro gresses you will develop a set of rules that will be used to make your choices.
If more than one rule fits the history, then the rule with the longer length will determine the choice.
For example, given the above history, since both [[1]] rule #2 and [[1]] rule #4 fit the history, [[1]] rule #2 will be used to make your choice since it is longer. [[slnc 500]] Therefore, given the history, and the three rules, your choice next period will be W, as prescribed by rule #2. [[1]] [[slnc 500]]

If no rules fit the history, then your [[1]] Default rule will be selected. The default rule will only be used when no rules fit the history. To select your default rule, [[1]] select either W or Y in the bottom left of your screen. [[2]] [[slnc 500]]

Additionally, you have to select the [[1]] First Period rule. [[slnc 500]] The first period rule [[slnc 100]] will only be used in the first period of the match. To select your first period rule [[slnc 100]] [[1]] select either W, or Y, in the bottom left of your screen. [[2]] [[slnc 500]]

Play will proceed automatically.[[slnc 500]] Each period, before the choice is made, [[1]] the rule that will be used to make the next choice [[slnc 100]] will be highlighted. [[slnc 500]]  [[2]] The corresponding sequence in the history will also be highlighted. [[1]] After the choice has been made, [[1]] the statistics for that rule will be updated, and the corresponding choice in the  [[6]] payoff table will also be highlighted. [[5]] [[slnc 500]]


[[2]] Lets look at another example. [[slnc 3000]] In the example above, Rule #4 and Rule #9 both fit the history. However, rule #9 will be
selected because it is longer. Therefore, W will be played in the next period.
For the example above, there are several ways to make changes to the rule set in order for Y to be played. [[slnc 500]] [[3]] First, you can delete Rule [[2]] #9. [[slnc 5000]] [[5]] Second, you can add a longer rule that fits the history and has Y as the output. [[41]] [[slnc 12000]] 

[[3]] Number of Periods Per Match [[slnc 500]]

The number of periods in each match will be determined randomly, using the following procedure. [[slnc 500]]

At the end of each period, [[2]] a number will be chosen randomly from the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, all the way up to, 18, 19, 20, where each number is equally likely.[[slnc 500]]
[[1]] If the number is 1, then the match will end. [[slnc 500]]
[[1]] If the number is not 1, then there will be an additional period. [[slnc 500]]
The number will always be placed back into the set after it is drawn.
Thus, in any period there is a 5% CHANCE that the match will end, and a 95% CHANCE that the match will have another period.
Therefore, [[1]] the expected number of periods in each match will be 20.
You will not see the number selected from the set.
To ensure that the length of the match is not dependent on your play, the number of periods for each match has been written on the board before the experiment, and will be uncovered at the end of the experiment.
Since your choices will be determined automatically from your rule set, each period will last 10 seconds. Therefore, the game will progress automatically, even if you don’t do anything.[[slnc 500]]


[[3]] Additional Information about Matches [[slnc 500]]

During matches 1 through 10, you will be able to construct the set of rules to make your choices. [[1]] All of the rules in your set at the end of one match [[slnc 100]] will remain in your set at the start of the next match. [[1]] Before the first match, [[1]] you will have 1 minute to look over the payoffs, [[1]] and an additional 10 minutes to construct your rules. [[1]] Before every other match, [[1]] you will have 2 minutes before play starts to edit your set of rules.[[slnc 500]]

[[4]] Editing your set of rules  [[slnc 500]]

In the experiment today, you will need to pay a cost to edit rules during the match. [[slnc 200]] More specifically, [[slnc 200]]

Before each match starts: [[slnc 500]] You can change your set of rules for free before the match starts. [[slnc 500]]

During the match: [[slnc 500]] If you want to make changes to your set of rules during the match, [[4]] you can click the “Unlock Rules” button. [[slnc 100]] The cost of editing your rules during the match is 0 points for clicking the “Unlock Rules” button, plus 1 point per second that you are editing the rules. [[slnc 500]] [[8]] While you are editing your rules, the cost will be displayed on the “Lock Rules” button, as well as at the top of the screen. [[3]] Once you are done editing your rules, you may click the “Lock Rules” button, after which point you will no longer incur any costs. [[slnc 500]]

[[3]] Payoffs[[slnc 500]]

[[1]] At the end of the experiment, you will be paid in cash. [[slnc 200]] [[1]] Your payoff at the end of the experiment will be the sum of the payoffs for each period. [[1]] Reminder: the exchange rate today is 500 Francs equals one US dollar. [[slnc 500]]

[[3]] Practice Match[[slnc 500]]

Next, you will be given the chance to participate in a practice match, to ensure that you are comfortable with the interface. [[slnc 500]]
It is important to note that in this practice match, [[slnc 500]]
[[1]] you will [[slnc 100]] NOT [[slnc 100]] be paid for the choices made in the practice match. [[slnc 500]]
[[1]] the payoffs are all listed as 0, so that you can focus on getting comfortable with the interface, rather than focusing on the payoffs. [[slnc 500]]
[[1]] You are NOT matched with another participant. Your opponent for the practice match is a computer that is playing RANDOMLY.[[slnc 1000]]


[[2]] Starting Rules [[slnc 500]]

Prior to the start of the experiment, you will have 10 minutes to construct your starting set of rules. 
During that time, you will be presented with a split-screen view of the construction screen. 
In this view, you will have an opportunity to test what your rule set will select as an output for a variety of hypothetical histories.
The split-screen will consist of two sides.  The right side is the "starting rules" side.  Rules added to this side will be added to your rule set at the start of the first match.  The left side is the "hypothetical rules" side.  Rules added to this side can be used to test to see what choices different combinations of rules will lead to.

You will be able to move rules from the Hypothetical Rules side to the Starting Rules side by clicking the blue move button. To delete rules from the Starting Rules side you will need to click delete button.

You will be able to see what your hypothetical and starting rule sets selects as a choice for next period for hypothetical histories that you construct. To construct a hypothetical history, you will need to click on the question marks in that history. 
Notice that you will be able to construct and store multiple histories of different lengths and different choice sequences at the same time by clicking the New button or the History number button at the top of the Hypothetical Rules side. 

For example, five periods of hypothetical History number 4 have been filled in. [[slnc 3000]]

[[1]] Another example, 14 periods of hypothetical History number 3 have been filled in. [[slnc 3000]]

In both examples, you can see what the Hypothetical Rules and the Starting Rules sets select as a choice for next period.

You will be able to make changes to your Hypothetical Rules and your Starting Rules for the duration of the 10 minutes. After the ten minutes are up, rules that are on the Starting Rules side will be your starting rules for the experiment. [[slnc 2000]]


 Now that we have completed the instructions, the Practice match will begin now.
