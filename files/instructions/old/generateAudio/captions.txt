[['Welcome to the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics ',2.50,2.63],['Laboratory. Please carefully watch these video instructions ',5.61,8.24],['and follow along on the paper copy at your desk. Experiment ',5.19,13.43],['Overview. You are about to participate in an experiment ',5.62,19.05],['in the economics of decision-making. If you listen ',4.64,23.69],['carefully, you could earn a large amount of money, ',2.94,26.63],['that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the ',4.09,30.71],['end of the experiment. It is important that you remain ',4.05,34.77],['silent, and do not look at other peoples work. If you ',5.13,39.90],['have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, ',3.45,43.34],['please raise your hand and an experimenter will help ',3.45,46.79],['you out. During the experiment, do not talk, laugh, ',4.96,51.75],['or exclaim out loud, and be sure to keep your eyes ',3.84,55.59],['on your screen only. In addition, please turn off your ',4.89,60.48],['cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the ',3.51,63.99],['experiment. Anybody that violates these rules will ',4.24,68.22],['be asked to leave and will not be paid. We expect, ',3.77,72.00],['and appreciate your cooperation. Agenda 1. We will ',8.51,80.51],['first go over the instructions. 2. Then we will have ',6.79,87.30],['a practice match to learn the interface. 3. There will ',6.68,93.97],['be a quiz with 10 questions to make sure everyone understands ',3.20,97.18],['the instructions. On the quiz, you will be able to ',5.07,102.25],['earn up to 50 cents for each of 10 quiz questions, ',2.64,104.89],['for a total of 5 dollars. If you answer the question ',5.09,109.97],['correctly on your first attempt, you earn 50 cents. ',3.46,113.43],['If you answer the question incorrectly on your first ',4.25,117.68],['attempt, and correctly on your second attempt, then ',3.65,121.33],['you earn 25 cents. If you don’t answer the question ',4.31,125.63],['correctly on your first two attempts, you will earn ',3.34,128.98],['nothing and the answer will be explained to you. You ',4.03,133.01],['must still answer the question correctly to move on ',2.82,135.83],['to the next question. 4. After the quiz, the experiment ',6.94,142.77],['will begin. In the experiment you will be working with ',4.93,147.70],['a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid ',4.32,152.02],['in US Dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange ',4.70,156.72],['rate today is: 1,500 Francs = 1 US Dollar. Experiment ',7.36,164.08],['Details This experiment consists of ten matches. At ',7.01,171.10],['the beginning of each match, you will be paired randomly ',3.12,174.22],['with one other participant. You will remain matched ',4.33,178.55],['with this same participant until the end of the match, ',2.52,181.07],['but then will be paired with another randomly selected ',2.95,184.02],['participant in the following match. Each match will ',4.70,188.72],['have the same structure, but may contain a different ',2.79,191.51],['number of periods. You will remain anonymous throughout ',5.00,196.51],['the experiment. You will not know the identity of the ',4.90,201.41],['participant that you are paired with, and they will ',2.65,204.06],['not know your identity. The choices made by you, and ',4.78,208.84],['the participant you are paired with, have no effect ',2.69,211.53],['on the payoffs of participants in other pairs, and ',3.60,215.13],['vice versa. Therefore, your payoff in a given match ',5.13,220.26],['is based solely on the choices made by you, and the ',3.52,223.78],['participant that you are paired with. Next, Lets Look ',5.18,228.96],['at the experimental Interface Specific Instructions ',5.33,234.29],['for Each Period Your payoff in each period will depend ',4.50,238.79],['on your choice, and the choice of the participant that ',3.33,242.12],['you are paired with. You will choose one of two options, ',3.78,245.91],['either W or Y. You will be able to see the payoffs ',4.98,250.89],['for each combination of choices for you and the participant ',3.04,253.93],['that you are paired with. These payoffs will remain ',4.40,258.33],['the same throughout the entire experiment (all matches). ',3.16,261.49],['The payoffs will be displayed in a table like this: ',4.34,265.83],['In this example above, the rows are the following: ',5.54,271.37],['Row #1 Your choice. (either W or Y in this example. ',6.71,278.08],[') Row #2 Other’s choice. (either W or Y in this example. ',8.07,286.15],[') Row #3 Your payoff. Row #4 Other’s payoff. Row ',10.99,297.14],['#5 Total number of times that that combination has ',4.47,301.61],['been played this match. For example, in the table above, ',5.39,307.00],['if you choose W, and the participant you are paired ',3.92,310.92],['with chooses Y you receive a payoff of 3, and the other ',4.77,315.69],['participant receives a payoff of 4. This combination ',4.30,319.99],['has occurred 19 times so far this match. In the table ',5.40,325.39],['above, if you choose W, and the participant you are ',4.27,329.66],['paired with chooses W, then you receive a payoff of ',3.75,333.41],['7, and the other participant receives a payoff of 4. ',3.48,336.89],['In the table above, if you choose Y, and the participant ',5.38,342.27],['you are paired with chooses Y you receive a payoff ',4.03,346.30],['of 1, and the other participant receives a payoff of ',3.85,350.15],['2. History As the match pro gresses, you will see the ',6.62,356.77],['history of play across the top of the screen, displayed ',3.15,359.92],['like this: The history tells your choice (labeled My ',6.26,366.17],['Choice), the choice of the participant you are paired ',2.75,368.92],['with (labeled Other’s Choice), the current period, ',3.26,372.19],['and the payoff for the current period. In the above ',4.56,376.75],['example, you played W, and the participant you are ',4.04,380.79],['paired with played Y in period 39. Rules Rather than ',7.48,388.27],['directly making choices of W or Y will develop a set ',4.39,392.65],['of rules which will automatically make choices 4 you. ',3.09,395.74],['The set of rules will appear in the middle of the screen. ',4.49,400.24],['You will be able to construct rules using the rule ',4.78,405.02],['constructor at the bottom of the screen. A rule consists ',4.96,409.98],['of two parts: Input Sequence sequence of choices by ',5.36,415.34],['you and the participant you are paired with. Output ',4.11,419.45],['choice to be made by you after the input sequence occurs. ',4.48,423.93],['Some example rules are displayed below: For example, ',6.07,430.00],['Rule #2 has an input sequence of YY ,WW ,YW, and an ',7.50,437.50],['output of W. This means that if you have played Y-W-Y ',4.06,441.57],['in the last three periods, and the participant that ',4.13,445.70],['you are paired with has played Y-W-W, this rule will ',4.01,449.70],['lead you to play W in the next period. The length of ',4.23,453.93],['the rule is measured by the length of the input sequence. ',2.64,456.57],['Therefore, rule #2 and rule #3 have a length of 3 rule ',7.78,464.34],['#4 has a length of 2. There are several ways that you ',5.64,469.99],['can modify your rules during the experiment. First, ',3.99,473.98],['you can use the rule constructor in the bottom center ',3.32,477.30],['of the screen. on the question marks to fill in the ',11.34,488.64],['boxes. When you click on a question mark, either a ',4.70,493.34],['W or a Y will appear. If you click on a W, it will ',5.42,498.77],['switch to a Y, and if you click on a Y, it will switch ',3.84,502.61],['to a W. Once you have completely filled in the rule ',4.89,507.50],['(leaving no question marks), the add rule button will ',3.90,511.40],['appear, and the rule can be added to your set. Second, ',5.32,516.71],['if you look at a rule in the set, you will notice a ',3.81,520.52],['green copy button and a red delete button. If you press ',5.48,526.00],['the copy button, it will copy the rule down to the ',3.25,529.25],['constructor and you will be able to create a similar ',2.30,531.55],['rule. If you press the red delete button it will delete ',4.40,535.95],['the rule from the set. Since your rule set needs to ',5.83,541.78],['make a single choice each period, it is not possible ',3.17,544.95],['to have two different rules with the same input sequence, ',3.17,548.12],['but with different outputs. If you create a rule that ',5.03,553.15],['has the same input sequence but a different output, ',2.48,555.63],['you will get an error that says “Conflicting rule ',3.17,558.80],['in set,” and a button that says “Switch Rule” ',2.48,561.28],['will appear. If you press this button, it will delete ',4.57,565.86],['the conflicting rule from the rule set, and add the ',3.09,568.95],['rule from the constructor. A rule of length n is said ',4.78,573.73],['to fit the history, if the input sequence matches the ',3.61,577.34],['last n periods of the history. For example, since the ',5.21,582.55],['last three periods of play in the above history (periods ',3.32,585.87],['42 through 44) have been YY, WW, and YW, and that sequence ',7.43,593.30],['is also the input for rule #2, then rule #2 is said ',4.83,598.13],['to fit the history. given the above history, we can ',5.61,603.74],['see that rule #4 fits the history, ]but rule #3 does ',4.39,608.13],['not fit the history. ] As play pro gresses you will ',5.34,613.47],['develop a set of rules that will be used to make your ',2.77,616.24],['choices. If more than one rule fits the history, then ',4.99,621.24],['the rule with the longer length will determine the ',2.61,623.85],['choice. For example, given the above history, since ',5.13,628.98],['both rule #2 and rule #4 fit the history, rule #2 will ',4.91,633.89],['be used to make your choice since it is longer. Therefore, ',4.62,638.51],['given the history, and the three rules, your choice ',4.12,642.63],['next period will be W, as prescribed by rule #2. If ',6.72,649.36],['no rules fit the history, then your Default rule will ',3.63,652.99],['be selected. The default rule will only be used when ',4.48,657.47],['no rules fit the history. To select your default rule, ',4.48,661.95],['select either W or Y in the bottom left of your screen. ',3.68,665.63],['Additionally, you have to select the First Period rule. ',5.55,671.18],['The first period rule will only be used in the first ',5.26,676.44],['period of the match. To select your first period rule ',4.69,681.13],['select either W, or Y, in the bottom left of your screen. ',4.54,685.67],['Play will proceed automatically. Each period, before ',7.46,693.13],['the choice is made, the rule that will be used to make ',3.15,696.28],['the next choice will be highlighted. The corresponding ',4.54,700.82],['sequence in the history will also be highlighted. After ',4.97,705.79],['the choice has been made, the statistics for that rule ',3.27,709.06],['will be updated, and the corresponding choice in the ',3.08,712.14],['payoff table will also be highlighted. Lets look at ',4.99,717.13],['another example. In the example above, Rule #4 and ',8.81,725.94],['Rule #9 both fit the history. However, rule #9 will ',5.84,731.78],['be selected because it is longer. Therefore, W will ',5.33,737.11],['be played in the next period. For the example above, ',4.16,741.27],['there are several ways to make changes to the rule ',3.31,744.58],['set in order for Y to be played. First, you can delete ',5.49,750.07],['Rule #9. Second, you can add a longer rule that fits ',10.94,761.00],['the history and has Y as the output. ] Number of Periods ',18.16,779.16],['Per Match The number of periods in each match will ',4.16,783.32],['be determined randomly, using the following procedure. ',3.04,786.36],['At the end of each period, a number will be chosen ',5.41,791.77],['randomly from the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, all the way ',5.22,796.99],['up to, 18, 19, 20, where each number is equally likely. ',5.85,802.85],['If the number is 1 or 2, then the match will end. If ',7.69,810.53],['the number is neither 1 nor 2, then there will be an ',3.52,814.05],['additional period. The number will always be placed ',4.69,818.74],['back into the set after it is drawn. Thus, in any period ',5.14,823.88],['there is a 5% CHANCE that the match will end, and a ',3.95,827.83],['95% CHANCE that the match will have another period. ',3.24,831.07],['Therefore, the expected number of periods in each match ',5.32,836.39],['will be 20. You will not see the number selected from ',4.41,840.80],['the set. To ensure that the length of the match is ',4.01,844.80],['not dependent on your play, the number of periods for ',3.33,848.14],['each match has been written on the board before the ',2.58,850.71],['experiment, and will be uncovered at the end of the ',2.81,853.52],['experiment. Since your choices will be determined automatically ',4.32,857.84],['from your rule set, each period will last 10 seconds. ',3.75,861.59],['Therefore, the game will progress automatically, even ',5.57,867.16],['if you don’t do anything. Additional Information ',4.27,871.44],['about Matches During matches 1 through 10, you will ',4.97,876.40],['be able to construct the set of rules to make your ',2.52,878.92],['choices. All of the rules in your set at the end of ',4.17,883.09],['one match will remain in your set at the start of the ',2.86,885.95],['next match. Before the first match, you will have 1 ',4.71,890.66],['Before every other match, you will have 2 minutes before ',9.64,900.30],['play starts to edit your set of rules. Editing your ',5.28,905.58],['set of rules In the experiment today, you will need ',4.21,909.79],['to pay a cost to edit rules during the match. More ',4.38,914.17],['specifically, Before each match starts: You can change ',4.83,919.00],['your set of rules for free before the match starts. ',2.60,921.60],['During the match: If you want to make changes to your ',6.04,927.64],['set of rules during the match, you can click the “Unlock ',3.00,930.63],['Rules” button. The cost of editing your rules during ',4.35,934.99],['the match is 0 points for clicking the “Unlock Rules” ',3.16,938.14],['button, plus 1 point per second that you are editing ',2.98,941.13],['the rules. While you are editing your rules, the cost ',5.06,946.19],['will be displayed on the “Lock Rules” button, as ',3.02,949.21],['well as at the top of the screen. Once you are done ',4.05,953.26],['editing your rules, you may click the “Lock Rules” ',2.75,956.01],['button, after which point you will no longer incur ',2.96,958.97],['any costs. Payoffs At the end of the experiment, you ',6.75,965.72],['will be paid in cash. Your payoff at the end of the ',4.34,970.06],['experiment will be the sum of the payoffs for each ',2.68,972.74],['period. Reminder: the exchange rate today is 1500 Francs ',6.13,978.87],['equals one US dollar. Practice Match Next, you will ',6.79,985.66],['be given the chance to participate in a practice match, ',2.83,988.50],['to ensure that you are comfortable with the interface. ',2.86,991.35],['It is important to note that in this practice match, ',5.14,996.49],['you will NOT be paid for the choices made in the practice ',4.05,1000.55],['match. the payoffs are all listed as 0, so that you ',6.08,1006.63],['can focus on getting comfortable with the interface, ',2.36,1008.99],['rather than focusing on the payoffs.
