window.captions=[['Welcome to the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics ',2.48,2.64],['Laboratory. Please carefully watch these video instructions ',5.62,8.26],['and follow along on the paper copy at your desk. Experiment ',5.19,13.45],['Overview. You are about to participate in an experiment ',5.61,19.06],['in the economics of decision-making. If you listen ',4.66,23.71],['carefully, you could earn a large amount of money, ',2.93,26.64],['that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the ',4.10,30.74],['end of the experiment. It is important that you remain ',4.04,34.78],['silent, and do not look at other peoples work. If you ',5.14,39.92],['have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, ',3.44,43.36],['please raise your hand and an experimenter will help ',3.45,46.81],['you out. During the experiment, do not talk, laugh, ',4.97,51.78],['or exclaim out loud, and be sure to keep your eyes ',3.83,55.61],['on your screen only. In addition, please turn off your ',4.89,60.49],['cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the ',3.52,64.01],['experiment. Anybody that violates these rules will ',4.23,68.24],['be asked to leave and will not be paid. We expect, ',3.77,72.01],['and appreciate your cooperation. Agenda 1. We will ',8.51,80.52],['first go over the instructions. 2. Then we will have ',6.80,87.32],['a practice match to learn the interface. 3. There will ',6.66,93.99],['be a quiz with 10 questions to make sure everyone understands ',3.22,97.20],['the instructions. On the quiz, you will be able to ',5.06,102.27],['earn up to 50 cents for each of 10 quiz questions, ',2.65,104.91],['for a total of 5 dollars. If you answer the question ',5.09,110.00],['correctly on your first attempt, you earn 50 cents. ',3.46,113.46],['If you answer the question incorrectly on your first ',4.24,117.70],['attempt, and correctly on your second attempt, then ',3.66,121.35],['you earn 25 cents. If you don’t answer the question ',4.31,125.66],['correctly on your first two attempts, you will earn ',3.34,129.00],['nothing and the answer will be explained to you. You ',4.02,133.02],['must still answer the question correctly to move on ',2.82,135.84],['to the next question. 4. After the quiz, the experiment ',6.95,142.80],['will begin. In the experiment you will be working with ',4.92,147.72],['a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid ',4.32,152.04],['in US Dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange ',4.71,156.75],['rate today is: 1,500 Francs = 1 US Dollar. Experiment ',7.35,164.10],['Details This experiment consists of ten matches. At ',7.02,171.12],['the beginning of each match, you will be paired randomly ',3.11,174.23],['with one other participant. You will remain matched ',4.33,178.56],['with this same participant until the end of the match, ',2.52,181.08],['but then will be paired with another randomly selected ',2.96,184.04],['participant in the following match. Each match will ',4.69,188.73],['have the same structure, but may contain a different ',2.79,191.52],['number of periods. You will remain anonymous throughout ',5.00,196.52],['the experiment. You will not know the identity of the ',4.90,201.42],['participant that you are paired with, and they will ',2.66,204.08],['not know your identity. The choices made by you, and ',4.78,208.87],['the participant you are paired with, have no effect ',2.69,211.56],['on the payoffs of participants in other pairs, and ',3.59,215.15],['vice versa. Therefore, your payoff in a given match ',5.13,220.28],['is based solely on the choices made by you, and the ',3.52,223.80],['participant that you are paired with. Next, Lets Look ',5.18,228.97],['at the experimental Interface Specific Instructions ',5.34,234.31],['for Each Period Your payoff in each period will depend ',4.49,238.81],['on your choice, and the choice of the participant that ',3.34,242.15],['you are paired with. You will choose one of two options, ',3.77,245.92],['either W or Y. You will be able to see the payoffs ',4.98,250.90],['for each combination of choices for you and the participant ',3.04,253.95],['that you are paired with. These payoffs will remain ',4.40,258.35],['the same throughout the entire experiment (all matches). ',3.16,261.50],['The payoffs will be displayed in a table like this: ',4.35,265.86],['In this example above, the rows are the following: ',5.54,271.40],['Row #1 Your choice. (either W or Y in this example. ',6.70,278.09],[') Row #2 Other’s choice. (either W or Y in this example. ',8.08,286.17],[') Row #3 Your payoff. Row #4 Other’s payoff. Row ',10.98,297.16],['#5 Total number of times that that combination has ',4.48,301.64],['been played this match. For example, in the table above, ',5.38,307.01],['if you choose W, and the participant you are paired ',3.94,310.95],['with chooses Y you receive a payoff of 3, and the other ',4.76,315.71],['participant receives a payoff of 4. This combination ',4.30,320.01],['has occurred 19 times so far this match. In the table ',5.40,325.40],['above, if you choose W, and the participant you are ',4.28,329.69],['paired with chooses W, then you receive a payoff of ',3.74,333.43],['7, and the other participant receives a payoff of 8. ',3.51,336.93],['In the table above, if you choose Y, and the participant ',5.24,342.17],['you are paired with chooses Y, then you receive a payoff ',4.02,346.19],['of 1, and the other participant receives a payoff of ',3.84,350.03],['2. History As the match pro gresses, you will see the ',6.63,356.66],['history of play across the top of the screen, displayed ',3.15,359.80],['like this: The history tells your choice (labeled My ',6.26,366.06],['Choice), the choice of the participant you are paired ',2.76,368.82],['with (labeled Other’s Choice), the current period, ',3.24,372.06],['and the payoff for the current period. In the above ',4.57,376.64],['example, you played W, and the participant you are ',4.03,380.67],['paired with played Y in period 39. Rules Rather than ',7.49,388.15],['directly making choices of W or Y will develop a set ',4.39,392.54],['of rules which will automatically make choices 4 you. ',3.09,395.63],['The set of rules will appear in the middle of the screen. ',4.49,400.12],['You will be able to construct rules using the rule ',4.78,404.91],['constructor at the bottom of the screen. A rule consists ',4.97,409.88],['of two parts: Input Sequence sequence of choices by ',5.35,415.23],['you and the participant you are paired with. Output ',4.11,419.34],['choice to be made by you after the input sequence occurs. ',4.48,423.82],['Some example rules are displayed below: For example, ',6.06,429.88],['Rule #2 has an input sequence of YY ,WW ,YW, and an ',7.50,437.38],['output of W. This means that if you have played Y-W-Y ',4.08,441.45],['in the last three periods, and the participant that ',4.13,445.59],['you are paired with has played Y-W-W, this rule will ',4.01,449.59],['lead you to play W in the next period. The length of ',4.23,453.82],['the rule is measured by the length of the input sequence. ',2.64,456.45],['Therefore, rule #2 and rule #3 have a length of 3 rule ',7.78,464.23],['#4 has a length of 2. There are several ways that you ',5.64,469.88],['can modify your rules during the experiment. First, ',3.99,473.87],['you can use the rule constructor in the bottom center ',3.32,477.19],['of the screen. ] the plus button to add more columns ',4.26,481.45],['or one of the minus buttons to subtract columns. on ',5.24,486.69],['the question marks to fill in the boxes. When you click ',4.33,491.02],['on a question mark, either a W or a Y will appear. ',3.69,494.71],['If you click on a W, it will switch to a Y, and if ',5.77,500.48],['you click on a Y, it will switch to a W. Once you have ',5.56,506.04],['completely filled in the rule (leaving no question ',2.69,508.73],['marks), the add rule button will appear, and the rule ',3.90,512.63],['can be added to your set. Second, if you look at a ',5.80,518.44],['rule in the set, you will notice a green copy button ',2.80,521.24],['and a red delete button. If you press the copy button, ',5.57,526.81],['it will copy the rule down to the constructor and you ',3.33,530.14],['will be able to create a similar rule. If you press ',3.94,534.08],['the red delete button it will delete the rule from ',2.67,536.75],['the set. Since your rule set needs to make a single ',5.34,542.09],['choice each period, it is not possible to have two ',3.78,545.87],['different rules with the same input sequence, but with ',3.36,549.23],['different outputs. If you create a rule that has the ',4.10,553.33],['same input sequence but a different output, you will ',3.23,556.55],['get an error that says “Conflicting rule in set,” ',2.52,559.07],['and a button that says “Switch Rule” will appear. ',2.71,561.78],['If you press this button, it will delete the conflicting ',4.41,566.19],['rule from the rule set, and add the rule from the constructor. ',3.59,569.78],['A rule of length n is said to fit the history, if the ',5.77,575.55],['input sequence matches the last n periods of the history. ',3.17,578.72],['For example, since the last three periods of play in ',5.46,584.17],['the above history (periods 42 through 44) have been ',4.49,588.67],['YY, WW, and YW, and that sequence is also the input ',5.98,594.64],['for rule #2, then rule #2 is said to fit the history. ',4.19,598.84],['given the above history, we can see that rule #4 fits ',6.49,605.33],['the history, ]but rule #3 does not fit the history. ',3.62,608.95],['] As play pro gresses you will develop a set of rules ',5.54,614.49],['that will be used to make your choices. If more than ',4.41,618.90],['one rule fits the history, then the rule with the longer ',3.20,622.10],['length will determine the choice. For example, given ',5.03,627.13],['the above history, since both rule #2 and rule #4 fit ',4.30,631.42],['the history, rule #2 will be used to make your choice ',3.53,634.95],['since it is longer. Therefore, given the history, and ',6.04,640.99],['the three rules, your choice next period will be W, ',3.24,644.23],['as prescribed by rule #2. If no rules fit the history, ',6.35,650.58],['then your Default rule will be selected. The default ',4.78,655.36],['rule will only be used when no rules fit the history. ',3.15,658.51],['To select your default rule, select either W or Y in ',5.87,664.38],['the bottom left of your screen. Additionally, you have ',5.04,669.42],['to select the First Period rule. The first period rule ',4.98,674.40],['will only be used in the first period of the match. ',3.08,677.48],['To select your first period rule select either W, or ',5.99,683.47],['Y, in the bottom left of your screen. Play will proceed ',5.24,688.71],['automatically. Each period, before the choice is made, ',5.36,694.07],['the rule that will be used to make the next choice ',2.75,696.82],['will be highlighted. The corresponding sequence in ',5.40,702.22],['the history will also be highlighted. After the choice ',4.05,706.27],['has been made, the statistics for that rule will be ',3.23,709.50],['updated, and the corresponding choice in the payoff ',2.60,712.10],['table will also be highlighted. Lets look at another ',5.07,717.17],['example. In the example above, Rule #4 and Rule #9 ',9.01,726.18],['both fit the history. However, rule #9 will be selected ',5.83,732.01],['because it is longer. Therefore, W will be played in ',5.68,737.69],['the next period. For the example above, there are several ',4.70,742.39],['ways to make changes to the rule set in order for Y ',3.35,745.74],['to be played. First, you can delete Rule #9. Second, ',12.14,757.89],['you can add a longer rule that fits the history and ',4.14,762.03],['has Y as the output. ] Number of Periods Per Match ',17.88,779.91],['The number of periods in each match will be determined ',3.65,783.56],['randomly, using the following procedure. At the end ',5.76,789.32],['of each period, a number will be chosen randomly from ',3.55,792.87],['the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, all the way up to, 18, ',5.18,798.05],['19, 20, where each number is equally likely. If the ',7.38,805.43],['number is 1, then the match will end. If the number ',5.10,810.53],['is not 1, then there will be an additional period. ',3.10,813.63],['The number will always be placed back into the set ',5.10,818.72],['after it is drawn. Thus, in any period there is a 5% ',4.95,823.67],['CHANCE that the match will end, and a 95% CHANCE that ',4.89,828.56],['the match will have another period. Therefore, the ',4.45,833.00],['expected number of periods in each match will be 20. ',2.98,835.99],['You will not see the number selected from the set. ',3.99,839.98],['To ensure that the length of the match is not dependent ',4.16,844.14],['on your play, the number of periods for each match ',3.27,847.41],['has been written on the board before the experiment, ',2.33,849.74],['and will be uncovered at the end of the experiment. ',2.81,852.55],['Since your choices will be determined automatically ',4.16,856.71],['from your rule set, each period will last 10 seconds. ',3.75,860.46],['Therefore, the game will progress automatically, even ',5.57,866.03],['if you don’t do anything. Additional Information ',4.27,870.30],['about Matches During matches 1 through 10, you will ',4.97,875.27],['be able to construct the set of rules to make your ',2.52,877.79],['choices. All of the rules in your set at the end of ',4.17,881.96],['one match will remain in your set at the start of the ',2.86,884.82],['next match. Before the first match, you will have 1 ',4.70,889.52],[' c construct your rules. Before every other match, ',7.67,897.19],['you will have 2 minutes before play starts to edit ',3.40,900.59],['your set of rules. Editing your set of rules In the ',6.20,906.79],['experiment today, you will need to pay a cost to edit ',3.20,910.00],['rules during the match. More specifically, Before each ',5.61,915.61],['match starts: You can change your set of rules for ',3.60,919.20],['free before the match starts. During the match: If ',5.71,924.92],['you want to make changes to your set of rules during ',2.47,927.39],['the match, you can click the “Unlock Rules” button. ',2.91,930.30],['The cost of editing your rules during the match is ',4.39,934.69],['0 points for clicking the “Unlock Rules” button, ',2.64,937.33],['plus 1 point per second that you are editing the rules. ',3.08,940.40],['While you are editing your rules, the cost will be ',5.20,945.61],['displayed on the “Lock Rules” button, as well as ',2.88,948.48],['at the top of the screen. Once you are done editing ',3.88,952.36],['your rules, you may click the “Lock Rules” button, ',2.83,955.19],['after which point you will no longer incur any costs. ',3.25,958.45],['Payoffs At the end of the experiment, you will be paid ',6.57,965.02],['in cash. Your payoff at the end of the experiment will ',4.84,969.86],['be the sum of the payoffs for each period. Reminder: ',3.87,973.72],['the exchange rate today is 1500 Francs equals one US ',5.12,978.84],['dollar. Practice Match Next, you will be given the ',6.30,985.15],['chance to participate in a practice match, to ensure ',3.22,988.36],['that you are comfortable with the interface. It is ',4.61,992.97],['important to note that in this practice match, you ',3.55,996.53],['will NOT be paid for the choices made in the practice ',2.89,999.42],['match. the payoffs are all listed as 0, so that you ',6.08,1005.50],['can focus on getting comfortable with the interface, ',2.35,1007.84],['rather than focusing on the payoffs. You are NOT matched ',5.56,1013.41],['with another participant. Your opponent for the practice ',4.27,1017.68],['match is a computer that is playing RANDOMLY. Starting ',5.58,1023.26],['Rules Prior to the start of the experiment, you will ',5.02,1028.28],['have 10 minutes to construct your starting set of rules. ',2.71,1030.98],['During that time, you will be presented with a split-screen ',4.48,1035.46],['view of the construction screen. In this view, you ',5.15,1040.62],['will have an opportunity to test what your rule set ',2.59,1043.21],['will select as an output for a variety of hypothetical ',2.62,1045.83],['histories. The split-screen will consist of two sides. ',4.99,1050.82],['The right side is the "starting rules" side. Rules ',5.99,1056.81],['added to this side will be added to your rule set at ',2.81,1059.62],['the start of the first match. The left side is the ',4.06,1063.69],['"hypothetical rules" side. Rules added to this side ',4.30,1067.98],['can be used to test to see what choices different combinations ',3.09,1071.07],['of rules will lead to. You will be able to move rules ',5.12,1076.19],['from the Hypothetical Rules side to the Starting Rules ',3.03,1079.22],['side by clicking the blue move button. To delete rules ',4.71,1083.93],['from the Starting Rules side you will need to click ',2.70,1086.64],['delete button. You will be able to see what your hypothetical ',4.34,1090.98],['and starting rule sets selects as a choice for next ',3.33,1094.31],['period for hypothetical histories that you construct. ',2.95,1097.26],['To construct a hypothetical history, you will need ',5.40,1102.66],['to click on the question marks in that history.
