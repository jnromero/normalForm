[['Welcome to the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics ',2.23],['Laboratory. Please carefully watch these video instructions ',4.04],['and follow along on the paper copy at your desk. Experiment ',3.88],['Overview. You are about to participate in an experiment ',4.06],['in the economics of decision-making. If you listen ',3.22],['carefully, you could earn a large amount of money, ',2.62],['that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the ',3.72],['end of the experiment. It is important that you remain ',2.68],['silent, and do not look at other peoples work. If you ',3.62],['have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, ',3.08],['please raise your hand and an experimenter will help ',3.17],['you out. During the experiment, do not talk, laugh, ',3.48],['or exclaim out loud, and be sure to keep your eyes ',3.42],['on your screen only. In addition, please turn off your ',3.38],['cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the ',3.17],['experiment. Anybody that violates these rules will ',2.86],['be asked to leave and will not be paid. We expect, ',2.39],['and appreciate your cooperation. Agenda 1. We will ',5.61],['first go over the instructions. 2. Then we will have ',4.07],['a practice match to learn the interface. 3. There will ',3.97],['be a quiz with 10 questions to make sure everyone understands ',2.89],['the instructions. On the quiz, you will be able to ',3.62],['earn up to 50 cents for each of 10 quiz questions, ',2.38],['for a total of 5 dollars. If you answer the question ',3.59],['correctly on your first attempt, you earn 50 cents. ',3.18],['If you answer the question incorrectly on your first ',2.89],['attempt, and correctly on your second attempt, then ',3.31],['you earn 25 cents. If you don’t answer the question ',2.89],['correctly on your first two attempts, you will earn ',3.04],['nothing and the answer will be explained to you. You ',2.74],['must still answer the question correctly to move on ',2.48],['to the next question. 4. After the quiz, the experiment ',4.25],['will begin. In the experiment you will be working with ',3.53],['a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid ',2.89],['in U.S. Dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange ',3.18],['rate today is: 1,500 Francs = 1 U.S. Dollar. Experiment ',5.92],['Details This experiment consists of ten matches. At ',5.33],['the beginning of each match, you will be paired randomly ',2.65],['with one other participant. You will remain matched ',2.90],['with this same participant until the end of the match, ',2.35],['but then will be paired with another randomly selected ',2.69],['participant in the following match. Each match will ',3.25],['have the same structure, but may contain a different ',2.52],['number of periods. You will remain anonymous throughout ',3.49],['the experiment. You will not know the identity of the ',3.47],['participant that you are paired with, and they will ',2.41],['not know your identity. The choices made by you, and ',3.27],['the participant you are paired with, have no effect ',2.47],['on the payoffs of participants in other pairs, and ',3.26],['vice versa. Therefore, your payoff in a given match ',3.56],['is based solely on the choices made by you, and the ',3.15],['participant that you are paired with. Next, Lets Look ',3.65],['at the experimental Interface Specific Instructions ',5.00],['for Each Period Your payoff in each period will depend ',3.88],['on your choice, and the choice of the participant that ',3.05],['you are paired with. You will choose one of two options, ',2.41],['either W or Y. You will be able to see the payoffs ',3.47],['for each combination of choices for you and the participant ',2.79],['that you are paired with. These payoffs will remain ',2.97],['the same throughout the entire experiment (all matches). ',2.86],['The payoffs will be displayed in a table like this: ',2.93],['In this example above, the rows are the following: ',4.98],['Row #1 Your choice. (either W or Y in this example.) ',5.00],['Row #2 Other’s choice. (either W or Y in this example.) ',5.21],['Row #3 Your payoff. Row #4 Other’s payoff. Row #5 ',7.16],['Total number of times that that combination has been ',3.91],['played this match. For example, in the table above, ',3.67],['if you choose W, and the participant you are paired ',3.54],['with chooses Y you receive a payoff of 3, and the other ',4.32],['participant receives a payoff of 4. This combination ',2.88],['has occurred 19 times so far this match. In the table ',3.90],['above, if you choose W, and the participant you are ',3.85],['paired with chooses W, then you receive a payoff of ',3.37],['7, and the other participant receives a payoff of 4. ',3.22],['In the table above, if you choose Y, and the participant ',3.78],['you are paired with chooses Y you receive a payoff ',3.67],['of 1, and the other participant receives a payoff of ',3.47],['2. History As the match pro gresses, you will see the ',4.95],['history of play across the top of the screen, displayed ',2.90],['like this: The history tells your choice (labeled My ',5.64],['Choice), the choice of the participant you are paired ',2.54],['with (labeled Other’s Choice), the current period, ',2.96],['and the payoff for the current period. In the above ',3.09],['example, you played W, and the participant you are ',3.68],['paired with played Y in period 39. Rules Rather than ',5.71],['directly making choices of W or Y will develop a set ',3.94],['of rules which will automatically make choices 4 you. ',2.81],['The set of rules will appear in the middle of the screen. ',3.07],['You will be able to construct rules using the rule ',3.31],['constructor at the bottom of the screen. A rule consists ',3.47],['of two parts: Input Sequence sequence of choices by ',4.85],['you and the participant you are paired with. Output ',2.88],['choice to be made by you after the input sequence occurs. ',3.85],['Some example rules are displayed below: For example, ',4.47],['Rule #2 has an input sequence of YY ,WW ,YW, and an ',6.78],['output of W. This means that if you have played Y-W-Y ',2.47],['in the last three periods, and the participant that ',3.73],['you are paired with has played Y-W-W, this rule will ',3.61],['lead you to play W in the next period. The length of ',3.06],['the rule is measured by the length of the input sequence. ',2.39],['Therefore, rule #2 and rule #3 have a length of 3 rule ',5.98],['#4 has a length of 2. There are several ways that you ',4.13],['can modify your rules during the experiment. First, ',2.76],['you can use the rule constructor in the bottom center ',2.93],['of the screen. the plus button to add more columns ',3.01],['or one of the minus buttons to subtract columns. on ',3.92],['the question marks to fill in the boxes. When you click ',2.95],['on a question mark, either a W or a Y will appear. ',3.30],['If you click on a W, it will switch to a Y, and if ',4.16],['you click on a Y, it will switch to a W. Once you have ',4.01],['completely filled in the rule (leaving no question ',2.47],['marks), the add rule button will appear, and the rule ',3.51],['can be added to your set. Second, if you look at a ',4.17],['rule in the set, you will notice a green copy button ',2.53],['and a red delete button. If you press the copy button, ',4.02],['it will copy the rule down to the constructor and you ',3.03],['will be able to create a similar rule. If you press ',2.57],['the red delete button it will delete the rule from ',2.45],['the set. Since your rule set needs to make a single ',3.62],['choice each period, it is not possible to have two ',3.38],['different rules with the same input sequence, but with ',3.05],['different outputs. If you create a rule that has the ',2.71],['same input sequence but a different output, you will ',2.93],['get an error that says “Conflicting rule in set,” ',2.29],['and a button that says “Switch Rule” will appear. ',2.41],['If you press this button, it will delete the conflicting ',2.95],['rule from the rule set, and add the rule from the constructor. ',3.24],['A rule of length n is said to fit the history, if the ',4.24],['input sequence matches the last n periods of the history. ',2.86],['For example, since the last three periods of play in ',3.91],['the above history (periods 42 through 44) have been ',4.07],['YY, WW, and YW, and that sequence is also the input ',5.33],['for rule #2, then rule #2 is said to fit the history. ',3.74],['Similarly, given the above history, we can see that ',4.10],['rule #4 fits the history, but rule #3 does not fit ',3.88],['the history. As play pro gresses you will develop a ',3.96],['set of rules that will be used to make your choices. ',2.08],['If more than one rule fits the history, then the rule ',3.63],['with the longer length will determine the choice. For ',2.97],['example, given the above history, since both rule #2 ',3.58],['and rule #4 fit the history, rule #2 will be used to ',4.25],['make your choice since it is longer. Therefore, given ',3.60],['the history, and the three rules, your choice next ',3.04],['period will be W, as prescribed by rule #2. If no rules ',5.18],['fit the history, then your Default rule will be selected. ',3.06],['The default rule will only be used when no rules fit ',3.41],['the history. To select your default rule, select either ',3.46],['W or Y in the bottom left of your screen. Additionally, ',3.45],['you have to select the First Period rule. The first ',3.83],['period rule will only be used in the first period of ',3.36],['the match. To select your first period rule select ',3.03],['either W, or Y, in the bottom left of your screen. ',3.46],['Play will proceed automatically. Each period, before ',4.66],['the choice is made, the rule that will be used to make ',2.84],['the next choice will be highlighted. The corresponding ',3.08],['sequence in the history will also be highlighted. After ',3.58],['the choice has been made, the statistics for that rule ',2.93],['will be updated, and the corresponding choice in the ',2.79],['payoff table will also be highlighted. In the example ',3.26],['above, Rule #4 and Rule #9 both fit the history. However, ',4.63],['rule #9 will be selected because it is longer. Therefore, ',4.04],['W will be played in the next period. For the example ',3.74],['above, there are several ways to make changes to the ',3.36],['rule set in order for Y to be played. First, you can ',3.84],['delete Rule #9. Second, you can add a longer rule that ',4.28],['fits the history and has Y as the output. Number of ',3.29],['Periods Per Match The number of periods in each match ',3.73],['will be determined randomly, using the following procedure. ',3.11],['At the end of each period, a number will be chosen ',4.05],['randomly from the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, all the way ',4.70],['up to, 18, 19, 20, where each number is equally likely. ',5.31],['If the number is 1 or 2, then the match will end. If ',5.04],['the number is neither 1 nor 2, then there will be an ',3.00],['additional period. The number will always be placed ',3.17],['back into the set after it is drawn. Thus, in any period ',3.61],['there is a 5% CHANCE that the match will end, and a ',3.61],['95% CHANCE that the match will have another period. ',2.96],['Therefore, the expected number of periods in each match ',3.77],['will be 20. You will not see the number selected from ',2.98],['the set. To ensure that the length of the match is ',2.66],['not dependent on your play, the number of periods for ',3.02],['each match has been written on the board before the ',2.40],['experiment, and will be uncovered at the end of the ',2.58],['experiment. Since your choices will be determined automatically ',2.95],['from your rule set, each period will last 10 seconds. ',3.39],['Therefore, the game will progress automatically, even ',3.99],['if you don’t do anything. Additional Information ',2.82],['about Matches During matches 1 through 10, you will ',4.66],['be able to construct the set of rules to make your ',2.30],['choices. All of the rules in your set at the end of ',2.79],['one match will remain in your set at the start of the ',2.58],['next match. Before the first match, you will have 1 ',3.26],['look over the payoffs, and an additional 10 minutes ',3.02],['to construct your rules. Before every other match, ',2.97],['you will have 2 minutes before play starts to edit ',3.07],['your set of rules. Editing your set of rules In the ',4.33],['experiment today, you will need to pay a cost to edit ',2.90],['rules during the match. More specifically, Before each ',3.82],['match starts: You can change your set of rules for ',3.29],['free before the match starts. During the match: If ',3.94],['you want to make changes to your set of rules during ',2.23],['the match, you can click the “Unlock Rules” button. ',2.62],['The cost of editing your rules during the match is ',3.01],['0 points for clicking the “Unlock Rules” button, ',2.35],['plus 1 point per second that you are editing the rules. ',2.82],['While you are editing your rules, the cost will be ',3.73],['displayed on the “Lock Rules” button, as well as ',2.57],['at the top of the screen. Once you are done editing ',2.50],['your rules, you may click the “Lock Rules” button, ',2.57],['after which point you will no longer incur any costs. ',2.95],['Payoffs At the end of the experiment, you will be paid ',4.42],['in cash. Your payoff at the end of the experiment will ',3.41],['be the sum of the payoffs for each period. Practice ',3.10],['Match Next, you will be given the chance to participate ',3.66],['in a practice match, to ensure that you are comfortable ',3.15],['with the interface. It is important to note that in ',3.70],['this practice match, you will NOT be paid for the choices ',3.51],['made in the practice match. the payoffs are all listed ',3.65],['as 0, so that you can focus on getting comfortable ',3.09],['with the interface, rather than focusing on the payoffs. ',3.08],['You are NOT matched with another participant. Your ',3.73],['opponent for the practice match is a computer that ',2.53]]
