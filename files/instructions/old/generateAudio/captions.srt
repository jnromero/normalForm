Welcome to the Vernon Smith Experimental Economics 

2
00:00:02,643 --> 00:00:08,262
Laboratory. Please carefully watch these video instructions 

3
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:13,451
and follow along on the paper copy at your desk. Experiment 

4
00:00:13,451 --> 00:00:19,059
Overview. You are about to participate in an experiment 

5
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:23,715
in the economics of decision-making. If you listen 

6
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:26,640
carefully, you could earn a large amount of money, 

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,738
that will be paid to you in cash, in private, at the 

8
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,779
end of the experiment. It is important that you remain 

9
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:39,922
silent, and do not look at other peoples work. If you 

10
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:43,358
have any questions, or need any assistance of any kind, 

11
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,806
please raise your hand and an experimenter will help 

12
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:51,775
you out. During the experiment, do not talk, laugh, 

13
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:55,606
or exclaim out loud, and be sure to keep your eyes 

14
00:00:55,606 --> 00:01:00,494
on your screen only. In addition, please turn off your 

15
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:04,012
cell phones, et cetera, and put them away during the 

16
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:08,238
experiment. Anybody that violates these rules will 

17
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:12,011
be asked to leave and will not be paid. We expect, 

18
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:20,521
and appreciate your cooperation. Agenda 1. We will 

19
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:27,324
first go over the instructions. 2. Then we will have 

20
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:33,988
a practice match to learn the interface. 3. There will 

21
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:37,204
be a quiz with 10 questions to make sure everyone understands 

22
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:42,266
the instructions. On the quiz, you will be able to 

23
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,913
earn up to 50 cents for each of 10 quiz questions, 

24
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:49,998
for a total of 5 dollars. If you answer the question 

25
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:53,458
correctly on your first attempt, you earn 50 cents. 

26
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,695
If you answer the question incorrectly on your first 

27
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:01,352
attempt, and correctly on your second attempt, then 

28
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:05,659
you earn 25 cents. If you don’t answer the question 

29
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,003
correctly on your first two attempts, you will earn 

30
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:13,020
nothing and the answer will be explained to you. You 

31
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,841
must still answer the question correctly to move on 

32
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:22,795
to the next question. 4. After the quiz, the experiment 

33
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:27,718
will begin. In the experiment you will be working with 

34
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:32,036
a fictitious currency called Francs. You will be paid 

35
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:36,750
in US Dollars at the end of the experiment. The exchange 

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,099
rate today is: 1,500 Francs = 1 US Dollar. Experiment 

37
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:51,123
Details This experiment consists of ten matches. At 

38
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:54,234
the beginning of each match, you will be paired randomly 

39
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:58,565
with one other participant. You will remain matched 

40
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:01,084
with this same participant until the end of the match, 

41
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,044
but then will be paired with another randomly selected 

42
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:08,735
participant in the following match. Each match will 

43
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:11,521
have the same structure, but may contain a different 

44
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:16,525
number of periods. You will remain anonymous throughout 

45
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:21,424
the experiment. You will not know the identity of the 

46
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:24,083
participant that you are paired with, and they will 

47
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:28,866
not know your identity. The choices made by you, and 

48
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:31,560
the participant you are paired with, have no effect 

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,147
on the payoffs of participants in other pairs, and 

50
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:40,279
vice versa. Therefore, your payoff in a given match 

51
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,796
is based solely on the choices made by you, and the 

52
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:48,974
participant that you are paired with. Next, Lets Look 

53
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:54,315
at the experimental Interface Specific Instructions 

54
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:58,807
for Each Period Your payoff in each period will depend 

55
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:02,151
on your choice, and the choice of the participant that 

56
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:05,924
you are paired with. You will choose one of two options, 

57
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:10,905
either W or Y. You will be able to see the payoffs 

58
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:13,946
for each combination of choices for you and the participant 

59
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:18,346
that you are paired with. These payoffs will remain 

60
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:21,504
the same throughout the entire experiment (all matches). 

61
00:04:21,504 --> 00:04:25,858
The payoffs will be displayed in a table like this: 

62
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:31,396
In this example above, the rows are the following: 

63
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:38,094
Row #1 Your choice. (either W or Y in this example. 

64
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:46,175
) Row #2 Other’s choice. (either W or Y in this example. 

65
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:57,158
) Row #3 Your payoff. Row #4 Other’s payoff. Row 

66
00:04:57,158 --> 00:05:01,639
#5 Total number of times that that combination has 

67
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,014
been played this match. For example, in the table above, 

68
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:10,950
if you choose W, and the participant you are paired 

69
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,710
with chooses Y you receive a payoff of 3, and the other 

70
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,005
participant receives a payoff of 4. This combination 

71
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:25,404
has occurred 19 times so far this match. In the table 

72
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:29,688
above, if you choose W, and the participant you are 

73
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:33,426
paired with chooses W, then you receive a payoff of 

74
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,933
7, and the other participant receives a payoff of 8. 

75
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:42,168
In the table above, if you choose Y, and the participant 

76
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,185
you are paired with chooses Y, then you receive a payoff 

77
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:50,028
of 1, and the other participant receives a payoff of 

78
00:05:50,028 --> 00:05:56,657
2. History As the match pro gresses, you will see the 

79
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,803
history of play across the top of the screen, displayed 

80
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:06,061
like this: The history tells your choice (labeled My 

81
00:06:06,061 --> 00:06:08,824
Choice), the choice of the participant you are paired 

82
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:12,063
with (labeled Other’s Choice), the current period, 

83
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:16,637
and the payoff for the current period. In the above 

84
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:20,666
example, you played W, and the participant you are 

85
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:28,154
paired with played Y in period 39. Rules Rather than 

86
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:32,543
directly making choices of W or Y will develop a set 

87
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:35,631
of rules which will automatically make choices 4 you. 

88
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,124
The set of rules will appear in the middle of the screen. 

89
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:44,907
You will be able to construct rules using the rule 

90
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:49,876
constructor at the bottom of the screen. A rule consists 

91
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:55,228
of two parts: Input Sequence sequence of choices by 

92
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:59,338
you and the participant you are paired with. Output 

93
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:03,820
choice to be made by you after the input sequence occurs. 

94
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,880
Some example rules are displayed below: For example, 

95
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,379
Rule #2 has an input sequence of YY ,WW ,YW, and an 

96
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,454
output of W. This means that if you have played Y-W-Y 

97
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:25,588
in the last three periods, and the participant that 

98
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:29,593
you are paired with has played Y-W-W, this rule will 

99
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:33,819
lead you to play W in the next period. The length of 

100
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,454
the rule is measured by the length of the input sequence. 

101
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:44,233
Therefore, rule #2 and rule #3 have a length of 3 rule 

102
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:49,875
#4 has a length of 2. There are several ways that you 

103
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:53,869
can modify your rules during the experiment. First, 

104
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:57,189
you can use the rule constructor in the bottom center 

105
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,450
of the screen. ] the plus button to add more columns 

106
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,686
or one of the minus buttons to subtract columns. on 

107
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:11,016
the question marks to fill in the boxes. When you click 

108
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:14,708
on a question mark, either a W or a Y will appear. 

109
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:20,478
If you click on a W, it will switch to a Y, and if 

110
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:26,039
you click on a Y, it will switch to a W. Once you have 

111
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,733
completely filled in the rule (leaving no question 

112
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:32,634
marks), the add rule button will appear, and the rule 

113
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:38,438
can be added to your set. Second, if you look at a 

114
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:41,236
rule in the set, you will notice a green copy button 

115
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:46,809
and a red delete button. If you press the copy button, 

116
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:50,141
it will copy the rule down to the constructor and you 

117
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:54,077
will be able to create a similar rule. If you press 

118
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,747
the red delete button it will delete the rule from 

119
00:08:56,747 --> 00:09:02,087
the set. Since your rule set needs to make a single 

120
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,872
choice each period, it is not possible to have two 

121
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:09,227
different rules with the same input sequence, but with 

122
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:13,325
different outputs. If you create a rule that has the 

123
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:16,553
same input sequence but a different output, you will 

124
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:19,072
get an error that says “Conflicting rule in set,” 

125
00:09:19,072 --> 00:09:21,777
and a button that says “Switch Rule” will appear. 

126
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:26,189
If you press this button, it will delete the conflicting 

127
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:29,776
rule from the rule set, and add the rule from the constructor. 

128
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:35,546
A rule of length n is said to fit the history, if the 

129
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,716
input sequence matches the last n periods of the history. 

130
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:44,172
For example, since the last three periods of play in 

131
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:48,665
the above history (periods 42 through 44) have been 

132
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:54,644
YY, WW, and YW, and that sequence is also the input 

133
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:58,835
for rule #2, then rule #2 is said to fit the history. 

134
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:05,325
given the above history, we can see that rule #4 fits 

135
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:08,947
the history, ]but rule #3 does not fit the history. 

136
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:14,485
] As play pro gresses you will develop a set of rules 

137
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:18,897
that will be used to make your choices. If more than 

138
00:10:18,897 --> 00:10:22,101
one rule fits the history, then the rule with the longer 

139
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:27,128
length will determine the choice. For example, given 

140
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:31,424
the above history, since both rule #2 and rule #4 fit 

141
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,953
the history, rule #2 will be used to make your choice 

142
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:40,990
since it is longer. Therefore, given the history, and 

143
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,229
the three rules, your choice next period will be W, 

144
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:50,580
as prescribed by rule #2. If no rules fit the history, 

145
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,363
then your Default rule will be selected. The default 

146
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,509
rule will only be used when no rules fit the history. 

147
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,384
To select your default rule, select either W or Y in 

148
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:09,422
the bottom left of your screen. Additionally, you have 

149
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:14,403
to select the First Period rule. The first period rule 

150
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:17,479
will only be used in the first period of the match. 

151
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:23,470
To select your first period rule select either W, or 

152
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,706
Y, in the bottom left of your screen. Play will proceed 

153
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:34,070
automatically. Each period, before the choice is made, 

154
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,821
the rule that will be used to make the next choice 

155
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:42,220
will be highlighted. The corresponding sequence in 

156
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,272
the history will also be highlighted. After the choice 

157
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,499
has been made, the statistics for that rule will be 

158
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:52,099
updated, and the corresponding choice in the payoff 

159
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:57,173
table will also be highlighted. Lets look at another 

160
00:11:57,173 --> 00:12:06,182
example. In the example above, Rule #4 and Rule #9 

161
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:12,010
both fit the history. However, rule #9 will be selected 

162
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,687
because it is longer. Therefore, W will be played in 

163
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:22,389
the next period. For the example above, there are several 

164
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,744
ways to make changes to the rule set in order for Y 

165
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:37,888
to be played. First, you can delete Rule #9. Second, 

166
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:42,033
you can add a longer rule that fits the history and 

167
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:59,912
has Y as the output. ] Number of Periods Per Match 

168
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,557
The number of periods in each match will be determined 

169
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:09,316
randomly, using the following procedure. At the end 

170
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:12,868
of each period, a number will be chosen randomly from 

171
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:18,046
the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, all the way up to, 18, 

172
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:25,430
19, 20, where each number is equally likely. If the 

173
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,526
number is 1, then the match will end. If the number 

174
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:33,626
is not 1, then there will be an additional period. 

175
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:38,723
The number will always be placed back into the set 

176
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:43,669
after it is drawn. Thus, in any period there is a 5% 

177
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:48,556
CHANCE that the match will end, and a 95% CHANCE that 

178
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:53,003
the match will have another period. Therefore, the 

179
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:55,986
expected number of periods in each match will be 20. 

180
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:59,980
You will not see the number selected from the set. 

181
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,136
To ensure that the length of the match is not dependent 

182
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,410
on your play, the number of periods for each match 

183
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,744
has been written on the board before the experiment, 

184
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:12,553
and will be uncovered at the end of the experiment. 

185
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:16,710
Since your choices will be determined automatically 

186
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,460
from your rule set, each period will last 10 seconds. 

187
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,033
Therefore, the game will progress automatically, even 

188
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:30,305
if you don’t do anything. Additional Information 

189
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:35,274
about Matches During matches 1 through 10, you will 

190
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,793
be able to construct the set of rules to make your 

191
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,961
choices. All of the rules in your set at the end of 

192
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,817
one match will remain in your set at the start of the 

193
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,519
next match. Before the first match, you will have 1 

194
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:57,193
 c construct your rules. Before every other match, 

195
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:00,595
you will have 2 minutes before play starts to edit 

196
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:06,794
your set of rules. Editing your set of rules In the 

197
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:09,998
experiment today, you will need to pay a cost to edit 

198
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:15,606
rules during the match. More specifically, Before each 

199
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:19,205
match starts: You can change your set of rules for 

200
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:24,917
free before the match starts. During the match: If 

201
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,389
you want to make changes to your set of rules during 

202
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,303
the match, you can click the “Unlock Rules” button. 

203
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:34,692
The cost of editing your rules during the match is 

204
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,327
0 points for clicking the “Unlock Rules” button, 

205
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:40,404
plus 1 point per second that you are editing the rules. 

206
00:15:40,404 --> 00:15:45,605
While you are editing your rules, the cost will be 

207
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,484
displayed on the “Lock Rules” button, as well as 

208
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:52,362
at the top of the screen. Once you are done editing 

209
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:55,195
your rules, you may click the “Lock Rules” button, 

210
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:58,445
after which point you will no longer incur any costs. 

211
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:05,017
Payoffs At the end of the experiment, you will be paid 

212
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:09,858
in cash. Your payoff at the end of the experiment will 

213
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:13,724
be the sum of the payoffs for each period. Reminder: 

214
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:18,844
the exchange rate today is 1500 Francs equals one US 

215
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:25,148
dollar. Practice Match Next, you will be given the 

216
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:28,364
chance to participate in a practice match, to ensure 

217
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:32,973
that you are comfortable with the interface. It is 

218
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:36,525
important to note that in this practice match, you 

219
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,416
will NOT be paid for the choices made in the practice 

220
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:45,499
match. the payoffs are all listed as 0, so that you 

221
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:47,845
can focus on getting comfortable with the interface, 

222
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:53,406
rather than focusing on the payoffs. You are NOT matched 

223
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:57,678
with another participant. Your opponent for the practice 

224
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:03,262
match is a computer that is playing RANDOMLY. Starting 

225
00:17:03,262 --> 00:17:08,278
Rules Prior to the start of the experiment, you will 

226
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,983
have 10 minutes to construct your starting set of rules. 

227
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:15,464
During that time, you will be presented with a split-screen 

228
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:20,619
view of the construction screen. In this view, you 

229
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,208
will have an opportunity to test what your rule set 

230
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,831
will select as an output for a variety of hypothetical 

231
00:17:25,831 --> 00:17:30,824
histories. The split-screen will consist of two sides. 

232
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:36,814
The right side is the "starting rules" side. Rules 

233
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:39,624
added to this side will be added to your rule set at 

234
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:43,687
the start of the first match. The left side is the 

235
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,983
"hypothetical rules" side. Rules added to this side 

236
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:51,071
can be used to test to see what choices different combinations 

237
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:56,191
of rules will lead to. You will be able to move rules 

238
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,221
from the Hypothetical Rules side to the Starting Rules 

239
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:03,935
side by clicking the blue move button. To delete rules 

240
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:06,640
from the Starting Rules side you will need to click 

241
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,982
delete button. You will be able to see what your hypothetical 

242
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:14,314
and starting rule sets selects as a choice for next 

243
00:18:14,314 --> 00:18:17,263
period for hypothetical histories that you construct. 

244
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:22,661
To construct a hypothetical history, you will need 

245
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:26,643
to click on the question marks in that history. Notice 

246
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:29,197
that you will be able to construct and store multiple 

247
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:31,937
histories of different lengths and different choice 

248
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:34,956
sequences at the same time by clicking the New button 

249
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,870
or the History number button at the top of the Hypothetical 

250
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,651
Rules side. For example, five periods of hypothetical 

251
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:52,428
History number 4 have been filled in. Another example, 

252
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:57,142
14 periods of hypothetical History number 3 have been 

253
00:18:57,142 --> 00:19:05,617
filled in. In both examples, you can see what the Hypothetical 

254
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:09,076
Rules and the Starting Rules sets select as a choice 

255
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:13,964
for next period. You will be able to make changes to 

256
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:16,820
your Hypothetical Rules and your Starting Rules for 

257
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,000
the duration of the 10 minutes. After the ten minutes 

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,471
are up, rules that are on the Starting Rules side will 

259
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:30,995
be your starting rules for the experiment. Now that 

260
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,432
we have completed the instructions, the Practice match
