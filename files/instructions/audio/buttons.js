'],[11.600,'  Welcome '],[12.845,'  You  are  about  to  participate  in  an  experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision making  '],[18.530,'  If  you  listen  carefully '],[20.091,'   you  could  earn  a  large  amount  of  money '],[22.108,'   that  will  be  paid  to  you  in  cash '],[24.107,'   in  private '],[24.978,'   at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[27.771,'  It  is  important  that  you  remain  silent '],[30.034,'   and  do  not  look  at  other  people\'s  work  '],[33.257,'  If  you  have  any  questions '],[35.083,'   or  need  any  assistance  of  any  kind '],[37.435,'   please  raise  your  hand  and  an  experimenter  will  help  you  out  '],[41.695,'  During  the  experiment '],[43.205,'   do  not  talk '],[44.180,'   laugh  or  exclaim  out  loud  and  be  sure  to  keep  your  eyes  on  your  screen  only  '],[49.301,'  In  addition '],[50.287,'   please  turn  off  your  cell  phones '],[52.187,'   etc  '],[53.989,'  and  put  them  away  during  the  experiment  '],[57.242,'  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules  will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid  '],[62.262,'  We  expect '],[63.032,'   and  appreciate  your  cooperation  '],[66.662,'  Agenda '],[67.955,'  one  '],[70.108,'  Instructions  '],[72.223,'  two  '],[74.536,'  Quiz '],[75.754,'   to  make  sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions   '],[80.326,'  The  quiz  will  consist  of  twelve  questions  '],[83.694,'  The  experiment  will  not  begin  until  everyone  has  correctly  answered  all  questions  '],[89.452,'  three  '],[91.679,'  Experiment  '],[93.699,'  four  '],[95.945,'  Survey  '],[97.676,'  After  you  have  completed  the  experiment '],[100.056,'   you  will  be  asked  to  answer  several  survey  questions  using  the  computer  '],[104.814,'  five  '],[107.122,'  Payment  '],[108.850,'  After  everyone  has  finished  the  survey '],[111.247,'   you  will  be  paid  in  cash  '],[114.361,'  Experiment  Overview '],[116.478,'  In  the  experiment  today  you  will  be  matched  into  pairs '],[119.742,'   and  will  be  asked  to  make  choices  '],[122.634,'  The  choices  made  by  you  may  affect  both  your  payoff '],[125.420,'   as  well  as  the  payoff  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  '],[129.541,'  Similarly '],[130.551,'   the  choices  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  may  affect  their  payoff  and  your  payoff  '],[136.611,'  Experiment  Details '],[138.802,'  In  the  experiment  today '],[140.498,'   you  will  be  working  with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs  '],[144.782,'  You  will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[149.287,'  Exchange  rate   '],[150.901,'  one thousand  Francs  equals  one  dollar  '],[154.205,'  This  experiment  consists  of  four  matches '],[156.902,'   each  of  which  may  have  a  different  number  of  periods '],[159.611,'   and  may  have  different  payoffs  '],[162.308,'  At  the  beginning  of  each  match '],[164.202,'   you  will  be  matched  with  one  other  subject  that  you  have  not  been  matched  with  before  '],[169.051,'  You  will  remain  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment  '],[172.636,'  You  will  not  know  the  identity  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[176.046,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  will  not  know  your  identity  '],[180.322,'  The  choices  made  by  you '],[181.995,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[183.991,'   have  no  effect  on  the  payoffs  of  other  pairs  of  subjects '],[187.379,'   and  vice  versa  '],[189.500,'  You  will  remain  matched  with  this  same  subject  until  the  end  of  the  match  '],[194.075,'  After  you  and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  have  finished  the  match '],[197.581,'   please  wait  quietly  for  all  pairs  to  finish  their  match  '],[201.890,'  Once  all  pairs  have  finished  their  match '],[204.155,'   you  will  be  randomly  re matched  with  another  subject  that  you  have  not  been  matched  with  yet '],[208.518,'   and  the  next  match  will  begin  '],[211.815,'  Experimental  Interface '],[214.007,'  Next '],[214.796,'   we  will  go  over  the  experimental  interface  '],[218.459,'  The  experimental  interface  consists  of  five  components '],[222.398,'  one  '],[224.555,'  The  payoff  table  is  displayed  at  the  top  left  of  the  screen  '],[229.032,'  The  payoff  table  has  your  choices '],[231.750,'   the  rows '],[232.684,'   U '],[233.372,'   and  D  '],[234.581,'  and  the  choices  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[237.879,'   the  columns '],[238.921,'   L '],[239.547,'   and  R   '],[241.773,'  For  any  combination  of  choices  for  you  and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[245.930,'   there  is  a  payoff  '],[248.092,'  Your  payoff  is  on  the  left '],[249.759,'   and  the  payoff  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  on  the  right  '],[254.122,'  For  example '],[255.277,'   if  you  choose  D '],[256.699,'   and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  chooses  L '],[259.455,'   then  your  payoff  is  six '],[261.183,'   and  the  payoff  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  three  '],[265.416,'  The  payoff  table  in  the  experiment  today  will  be  different  than  the  one  displayed  here  '],[271.105,'  In  addition '],[272.076,'   the  payoffs  will  remain  the  same  for  all  periods  in  a  single  match '],[275.855,'   but  may  change  in  different  matches  '],[278.812,'  two  '],[280.925,'  The  summary  of  the  current  period  is  shown  in  the  top  right  '],[285.170,'  three  '],[287.413,'  The  summary  of  all  periods  is  shown  below  that  '],[291.311,'  four  '],[293.570,'  The  history  of  play  is  displayed  in  the  bottom  half  of  the  screen  '],[298.245,'  five  '],[300.554,'  Finally '],[301.443,'   the  current  status  is  displayed  across  the  middle  of  the  screen  '],[306.009,'  The  current  status  tells  you  what  to  do  at  any  point  during  the  experiment  '],[311.633,'  Specific  Instructions  for  Each  Period '],[314.638,'  At  any  point  during  a  period '],[316.386,'   you  will  see  one  of  three  status  messages '],[319.319,'  Status   number one '],[321.316,'  Please  select  My  Choice '],[323.381,'   U '],[324.043,' D  '],[325.187,'  and  your  guess  for  Other\'s  Choice '],[327.632,'   L '],[328.232,' R   '],[330.543,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[332.598,'   you  need  to  do  two  things  '],[335.426,'  one  '],[337.786,'  Select  a  row  for  your  choice '],[340.056,'   in  this  example  either  U '],[341.753,'   or  D   '],[344.005,'  Once  you  have  selected  a  row '],[345.885,'   it  will  be  outlined '],[347.228,'   and  the  label  My  Choice  will  be  added  '],[350.118,'  My  choice  will  also  be  updated  on  the  period  summary  '],[354.237,'  two  '],[356.339,'  Select  the  column  that  you  think  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  will  select '],[360.826,'   in  this  example  either  L '],[362.671,'   or  R   '],[364.819,'  Once  you  have  selected  a  column '],[366.782,'   it  will  be  outlined '],[368.125,'   and  the  label  My  Guess  will  be  added  '],[371.040,'  My  guess  will  also  be  updated  on  the  period  summary  '],[375.076,'  If  you  correctly  guess  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  in  a  given  period '],[379.572,'   then  you  will  earn  a  raffle  ticket  '],[382.401,'  At  the  end  of  each  match '],[384.011,'   one  raffle  ticket  will  be  randomly  selected '],[386.787,'   and  the  winner  will  receive  a  bonus  of  five  dollars  '],[390.658,'  Status   number two '],[392.626,'  Please  wait  for  the  other  subject  to  finish  making  their  choices  '],[397.062,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[399.132,'   please  wait  patiently  for  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  to  finish  making  their  choices  '],[405.074,'  If  the  other  subject  makes  their  choices  before  you  in  a  specific  period '],[409.156,'   you  might  not  see  this  status  '],[411.991,'  Status   number three '],[414.097,'  Click  on  the  payoffs  for  this  period '],[416.703,'   in  green  '],[418.096,'  in  the  game  table  to  move  to  next  period  '],[421.616,'  When  you  see  this  status  message '],[423.671,'   all  choices  for  the  period  have  been  made '],[426.131,'   and  you  can  view  the  final  results  '],[429.256,'  The  column  selected  by  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  highlighted  and  labeled  Other\'s  Choice  '],[435.631,'  If  your  guess  about  their  choice  was  correct '],[438.049,'   then  the  column  will  be  highlighted  in  yellow  '],[441.573,'  The  entry  of  the  payoff  table  that  is  at  the  intersection  of  the  row  that  you  selected '],[446.070,'   and  the  column  that  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  selected '],[449.354,'   is  highlighted  in  green  '],[451.875,'  This  entry  displays  the  payoffs  for  the  current  period  '],[455.977,'  Your  payoff  for  the  period  is  displayed  on  the  left '],[458.989,'   and  the  payoff  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is  displayed  on  the  right  '],[464.017,'  At  this  point '],[465.041,'   the  period  summary  has  been  updated  to  include  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with '],[469.931,'   and  the  current  payoffs  for  this  period  '],[473.141,'  These  choices  have  also  been  added  to  the  history  of  play  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  '],[478.726,'  Finally '],[479.617,'   the  overall  summary  has  been  updated  to  include  the  total  payoffs  including  this  period '],[484.628,'   as  well  as  the  number  of  correct  guesses  you  have  made  about  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  '],[490.752,'  To  move  on  to  the  next  period '],[492.642,'   you  need  to  click  the  payoffs  for  this  period  in  the  game  table '],[496.077,'   which  have  been  highlighted  in  green  '],[502.401,'  Number  of  Periods  Per  Match '],[504.829,'  The  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined  randomly  using  the  following  procedure  '],[510.727,'  At  the  end  of  each  period '],[512.379,'   a  number  will  be  chosen  randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   '],[515.915,' one '],[516.676,' two '],[517.376,' three '],[518.167,'   up  to '],[519.023,'   ninety eight '],[520.074,'   ninety nine '],[521.199,'   one hundred '],[522.127,'   where  each  number  is  equally  likely  '],[525.248,'  If  the  number  is  one '],[526.827,'   then  the  match  will  end  '],[529.185,'  If  the  number  is  not  one '],[531.040,'   then  the  match  will  continue  '],[533.693,'  The  number  will  always  be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn  '],[538.488,'  Thus '],[539.165,'   in  any  period  there  is  a  one  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  end '],[542.970,'   and  a  ninety nine  percent  CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period  '],[547.773,'  Therefore '],[548.682,'   the  expected  number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  one hundred  '],[553.338,'  This  procedure  has  been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment  '],[558.394,'  Therefore '],[559.299,'   you  will  not  see  the  number  selected  from   '],[561.505,' one '],[562.265,' two '],[562.966,' three '],[563.757,'   up  to '],[564.613,'   ninety eight '],[565.663,'   ninety nine '],[566.776,'   one hundred '],[568.721,'  To  ensure  that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent  on  your  play '],[572.315,'   the  number  of  periods  for  each  match  has  be  written  on  the  board  before  the  experiment '],[576.918,'   and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[581.122,'  Payoffs '],[582.475,'  Your  payoff  at  the  end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the  sum  of  the  payoffs  for  each  period  '],[588.076,'  In  addition '],[589.045,'   you  may  receive  a  bonus  payoff  if  your  raffle  ticket  is  randomly  selected  at  the  end  of  the  match  '],[595.216,'  These  bonus  payoffs  won\'t  be  displayed  until  the  end  of  the  experiment  '],[600.228,'  At  the  end  of  the  experiment '],[602.133,'   your  earnings  in  Francs  will  be  converted  into  US  Dollars  and  you  will  be  paid  in  cash '],[606.888,'   in  private  '],[608.963,'']];
