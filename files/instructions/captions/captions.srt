00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:01,943
  Welcome  to   the   Economic  Science   Laboratory. 

2
00:00:01,943 --> 00:00:05,925
 Please  carefully  watch  these  video  instructions 

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,827
 and  follow  along  on  the  paper  copy  at  your 

4
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:13,678
 desk.   Welcome  You  are  about  to  participate 

5
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:16,510
 in  an   experiment  in  the  economics  of  decision-making. 

6
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:20,652
 If  you  listen  carefully,   you  could  earn  a 

7
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:23,014
 large  amount  of  money,  that  will  be  paid  to 

8
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,692
 you  in  cash,  in  private,  at  the  end  of  the 

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,094
 experiment.  It  is  important   that  you  remain 

10
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:31,866
 silent,  and  do  not  look  at  other  people's  work. 

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:35,871
 If  you  have  any  questions,  or  need  any  assistance 

12
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,459
 of  any  kind,   please  raise  your  hand  and  an 

13
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:42,068
 experimenter  will  help  you  out.   During  the 

14
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:45,051
 experiment,   do  not  talk,  laugh  or  exclaim  out 

15
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:47,229
 loud  and  be  sure  to   keep  your  eyes  on  your 

16
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:51,148
 screen  only.  In  addition,   please  turn  off  your 

17
00:00:51,148 --> 00:00:54,847
 cell  phones,  etc.  and  put  them  away  during 

18
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:58,969
 the  experiment.  Anybody  that  violates  these  rules 

19
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,887
 will  be  asked  to  leave  and  will  not  be  paid. 

20
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:04,093
  We  expect,  and  appreciate  your  cooperation. 

21
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:15,974
  Agenda   1.  Instructions.   2.  Quiz  (to  make 

22
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:20,326
 sure  everyone  understands  the  instructions).  The 

23
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,892
 quiz  will  consist  of  12  questions.  The  experiment 

24
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:26,661
 will  not  begin  until  everyone  has  correctly 

25
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:35,945
 answered  all  questions.   3.  Experiment.   4.  Survey. 

26
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:40,056
 After  you  have  completed  the  experiment,  you 

27
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:42,121
 will  be  asked  to  answer  several  survey  questions 

28
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:49,253
 using  the  computer.   5.  Payment.  After  everyone 

29
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:52,200
 has  finished  the  survey,  you  will  be  paid  in 

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,889
 cash.   Experiment  Overview  In  the  experiment 

31
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,742
 today  you  will  be   matched  into  pairs,  and 

32
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:02,834
 will  be  asked  to  make  choices.  The  choices 

33
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,420
 made  by  you  may   affect  both  your  payoff,  as 

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,564
 well  as   the  payoff  of  the  subject  that  you 

35
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:11,146
 are  matched  with.  Similarly,  the  choices  of 

36
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:13,130
 the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  may   affect 

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,609
 their  payoff  and  your  payoff.   Experiment  Details 

38
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,117
 In  the  experiment  today,  you  will  be  working 

39
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:24,782
 with  a  fictitious  currency  called  Francs.  You 

40
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:26,926
 will  be  paid  in  US  Dollars  at  the  end  of 

41
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:31,610
 the  experiment.   Exchange  rate  :  1000  Francs 

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,795
 equals  1  dollar.  This  experiment  consists  of 

43
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:37,910
  four  matches,  each  of  which  may  have  a  different 

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,735
 number  of  periods,  and  may  have  different  payoffs. 

45
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:44,589
 At  the  beginning  of  each  match,   you  will  be 

46
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:46,522
 matched  with  one  other  subject  that  you  have 

47
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:49,369
 not  been  matched  with  before.  You  will  remain 

48
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,815
  anonymous  throughout  the  experiment.  You  will 

49
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,146
 not  know  the  identity  of  the  subject  that  you 

50
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:56,953
 are  matched  with,  and  the  subject  that  you 

51
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,405
 are  matched  with  will  not  know  your  identity. 

52
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:02,798
 The  choices  made  by  you,  and  the  subject  that 

53
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:05,054
 you  are  matched  with,  have  no  effect  on  the 

54
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,614
 payoffs  of  other  pairs  of  subjects,  and  vice 

55
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:10,895
 versa.  You  will  remain  matched  with  this   same 

56
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:14,463
 subject  until  the  end  of  the  match.  After  you 

57
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:16,406
 and  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  have 

58
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:18,775
 finished  the  match,  please  wait  quietly  for 

59
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:22,409
 all  pairs  to  finish  their  match.  Once  all  pairs 

60
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,725
 have  finished  their  match,  you  will  be   randomly 

61
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:27,197
 rematched  with  another  subject  that  you  have 

62
00:03:27,197 --> 00:03:29,209
 not  been  matched  with  yet,  and  the  next  match 

63
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,796
 will  begin.   Experimental  Interface  Next,  we 

64
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:38,459
 will  go  over  the  experimental  interface.  The 

65
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,100
 experimental  interface  consists  of  five  components: 

66
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,750
 1.   The  payoff  table  is  displayed  at  the  top 

67
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,379
 left  of  the  screen.  The  payoff  table  has  your 

68
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:54,981
 choices  (the  rows,   U,  and   D),  and  the  choices 

69
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:57,879
 of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  (the 

70
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,090
 columns,   L,  and   R).  For  any  combination  of 

71
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,159
 choices  for  you  and  the  subject  that  you  are 

72
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,303
 matched  with,  there  is  a  payoff.  Your  payoff 

73
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,874
 is  on  the  left,  and  the  payoff  for  the  subject 

74
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:12,733
 that  you  are  matched  with  is  on  the  right. 

75
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:17,126
 For  example,  if  you   choose  D,  and  the  subject 

76
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,455
 that  you  are  matched  with   chooses  L,   then 

77
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:22,399
 your  payoff  is  6,  and  the  payoff  for  the  subject 

78
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,603
 that  you  are  matched  with  is  3.  The  payoff 

79
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:28,227
 table  in  the  experiment  today  will  be  different 

80
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:32,076
 than  the  one  displayed  here.  In  addition,  the 

81
00:04:32,076 --> 00:04:34,064
 payoffs  will  remain  the  same  for  all  periods 

82
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:36,628
 in  a  single  match,  but  may  change  in  different 

83
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:42,358
 matches.  2.   The  summary  of  the  current  period 

84
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:47,606
 is  shown  in  the  top  right.  3.   The  summary 

85
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:53,570
 of  all  periods  is  shown  below  that.  4.   The 

86
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,823
 history  of  play  is  displayed  in  the  bottom 

87
00:04:55,823 --> 00:05:01,654
 half  of  the  screen.  5.   Finally,  the  current 

88
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:04,401
 status  is  displayed  across  the  middle  of  the 

89
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,506
 screen.  The  current  status  tells  you  what  to 

90
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:11,633
 do  at  any  point  during  the  experiment.   Specific 

91
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,270
 Instructions  for  Each  Period  At  any  point  during 

92
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,604
 a  period,  you  will  see  one  of  three  status 

93
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:22,410
 messages:  Status  #1:  Please  select  My  Choice 

94
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,632
 (U,D)  and  your  guess  for  Other's  Choice  (L,R). 

95
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:32,870
 When  you  see  this  status  message,  you  need 

96
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,910
 to  do  two  things.  1.  Select  a  row  for  your 

97
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,005
 choice  (in  this  example  either  U,  or  D).   Once 

98
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,581
 you  have  selected  a  row,  it  will  be  outlined, 

99
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:50,118
 and  the  label  'My  Choice'  will  be  added.   My 

100
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:52,515
 choice  will  also  be  updated  on  the  period  summary. 

101
00:05:52,515 --> 00:05:58,139
 2.  Select  the  column  that  you  think  the  subject 

102
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,034
 that  you  are  matched  with  will  select  (in  this 

103
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:05,424
 example  either  L,  or  R).   Once  you  have  selected 

104
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,471
 a  column,  it  will  be  outlined,  and  the  label 

105
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:11,543
 'My  Guess'  will  be  added.   My  guess  will  also 

106
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:15,434
 be  updated  on  the  period  summary.  If  you  correctly 

107
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,580
 guess  the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are 

108
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,934
 matched  with  in  a  given  period,  then  you  will 

109
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:23,581
 earn  a  raffle  ticket.  At  the  end  of  each  match, 

110
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:26,009
 one  raffle  ticket  will  be  randomly  selected, 

111
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,083
 and  the  winner  will  receive  a  bonus  of  5  dollars. 

112
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:33,837
  Status  #2:  Please  wait  for  the  other  subject 

113
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:37,528
 to  finish  making  their  choices.  When  you  see 

114
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:40,211
 this  status  message,  please  wait  patiently  for 

115
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:42,368
 the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  to  finish 

116
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,189
 making  their  choices.  If  the  other  subject  makes 

117
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,420
 their  choices  before  you  in  a  specific  period, 

118
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,550
 you  might  not  see  this  status.   Status  #3: 

119
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,058
 Click  on  the  payoffs  for  this  period  (in  green) 

120
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,839
 in  the  game  table  to  move  to  next  period. 

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,878
 When  you  see  this  status  message,  all  choices 

122
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:06,557
 for  the  period  have  been  made,  and  you  can 

123
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:09,879
 view  the  final  results.   The  column  selected 

124
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,369
 by  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with  is 

125
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:15,631
 highlighted  and  labeled  'Other's  Choice'.  If 

126
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,049
 your  guess  about  their  choice  was  correct,  then 

127
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:21,573
 the  column  will  be  highlighted  in  yellow.   The 

128
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:23,833
 entry  of  the  payoff  table  that  is  at  the  intersection 

129
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,459
 of  the  row  that  you  selected,  and  the  column 

130
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,401
 that  the  subject  that  you  are  matched  with 

131
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:32,070
 selected,  is  highlighted  in  green.  This  entry 

132
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,209
 displays  the  payoffs  for  the  current  period. 

133
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,194
 Your  payoff  for  the  period  is  displayed  on 

134
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,601
 the  left,  and  the  payoff  of  the  subject  that 

135
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:42,616
 you  are  matched  with  is  displayed  on  the  right. 

136
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,490
 At  this  point,  the  period  summary  has  been 

137
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,482
 updated  to  include   the  choice  of  the  subject 

138
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:50,297
 that  you  are  matched  with,   and  the  current 

139
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,714
 payoffs  for  this  period.  These  choices  have 

140
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,198
 also  been  added  to  the   history  of  play  at 

141
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:59,796
 the  bottom  of  the  screen.  Finally,   the  overall 

142
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:02,478
 summary  has  been  updated  to  include   the  total 

143
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,176
 payoffs  including  this  period,  as  well  as   the 

144
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,184
 number  of  correct  guesses  you  have  made  about 

145
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:09,192
 the  choice  of  the  subject  that  you  are  matched 

146
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:12,642
 with.   To  move  on  to  the  next  period,  you 

147
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,942
 need  to  click  the  payoffs  for  this  period  in 

148
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,691
 the  game  table,  which  have  been  highlighted 

149
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:24,829
 in   green.   Number  of  Periods  Per  Match  The 

150
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,919
 number  of  periods  in  each  match  will  be  determined 

151
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,910
 randomly  using  the  following  procedure.  At  the 

152
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,423
 end  of  each  period,   a  number  will  be  chosen 

153
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:38,167
 randomly  from  the  set  of  numbers   {1,2,3,  up 

154
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:43,092
 to,  98,  99,  100},  where  each  number  is  equally 

155
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:47,301
 likely.   If  the  number  is  1,  then  the  match 

156
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,250
 will  end.   If  the  number  is  not  1,  then  the 

157
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,496
 match  will  continue.  The  number  will  always 

158
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:57,105
 be  placed  back  into  the  set  after  it  is  drawn. 

159
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:01,577
 Thus,  in  any  period  there  is  a  1  percent  CHANCE 

160
00:09:01,577 --> 00:09:03,923
 that  the  match  will  end,  and  a  99  percent 

161
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,018
 CHANCE  that  the  match  will  have  another  period. 

162
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:10,611
 Therefore,   the  expected  number  of  periods  in 

163
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:14,112
 each  match  will  be  100.   This  procedure  has 

164
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,432
 been  performed  on  the  computer  before  the  experiment. 

165
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:20,577
 Therefore,  you  will  not  see  the  number  selected 

166
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:28,922
 from  {1,2,3,  up  to,  98,  99,  100}.  To  ensure 

167
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,936
 that  the  length  of  the  match  is  not  dependent 

168
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,783
 on  your  play,  the  number  of  periods  for  each 

169
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,801
 match  has  be  written  on  the  board  before  the 

170
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,255
 experiment,  and  will  be  uncovered  at  the  end 

171
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:43,179
 of  the  experiment.   Payoffs  Your  payoff  at  the 

172
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:45,292
 end  of  the  experiment  will  be  the   sum  of 

173
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:49,045
 the  payoffs  for  each  period.  In  addition,  you 

174
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,997
 may  receive  a   bonus  payoff  if  your  raffle 

175
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,658
 ticket  is  randomly  selected  at  the  end  of  the 

176
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:56,622
 match.  These  bonus  payoffs  won't  be   displayed 

177
00:09:56,622 --> 00:10:00,610
 until  the  end  of  the  experiment.  At  the  end 

178
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,966
 of  the  experiment,   your  earnings  in  Francs 

179
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,674
 will  be  converted  into  US  Dollars  and  you  will
